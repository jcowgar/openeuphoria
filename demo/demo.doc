		DEMO Programs Written in Euphoria
		---------------------------------

 This directory (and its subdirectories) contain a number of example programs
 written in Euphoria. You are encouraged to modify and redistribute any of 
 these programs. See License.txt for the details.
 
 To run a program type 'eui' followed by the file name. e.g.
     
      eui buzz.ex
      
 If you have associated .ex files with eui.exe you can simply double-click 
 to run any file. However, many programs expect to be run from the command
 line and they will terminate immediately after displaying something.

 You can view and modify these programs using any editor, but we recommend 
 using the Euphoria editor, ed, so you can get color syntax highlighting. 

 See also the tutorial directory for some very simple programs.
 
 NAME	  DESCRIPTION
 ----      -----------

 allsorts.ex - comparison of different sorting algorithms

 animal.ex - guess the animal game. It learns as you play.
	   
 buzz.ex   - "buzzword" generator - Try adding your own phrases.

 callmach.ex - examples of calling machine code from Euphoria

 chat_client.ex - socket example that connects to the multi-user
                  chat_server.ex application.

 char_server.ex - socket example that shows off using non-blocking
                  sockets and a multi-user server w/no threads
                  needed.

 csort.ex    - an example of calling custom_sort() with a routine id
 
 hash.ex   - counts the frequency of words in standard input by building a
             hash table (compare with tree.ex below). 
             Example:
                
                   eui hash < demo.doc
             
             Then view the hash.out file.
             
 mydata.ex - a simple database program that 
             uses EDS - the Euphoria Database System

 news.ex   - A multitasking demo that retrieves information from
             several Web sites in parallel. wget is required. 
             It is probably already available on your Linux or FreeBSD
             system. See the top of news.ex for details.
 
 pipes.ex  - Starts a sub-process and communicates to it via piped io.
             The sub process is pipe_sub.ex
 
 queens.ex - solves the N queens problem - how to place N queens on an NxN
	     chess board so they do not attack each other

 regexs.ex - does some simple regular expression operations

 sanity.ex - this program tests hundreds of features of Euphoria, in a quick,
	     self-test. If this program reports "PASSED" then Euphoria is
	     working on your machine.
             
 tree.ex   - counts the frequency of words in standard input by building a
             binary tree (compare with hash.ex above). 
             Example:
             
                 eui tree < demo.doc

 wget.ex   - uses Euphoria's socket include to download the content of a
             website.

 httpd.ex  - very simple example of a HTTP server.

 pastey.ex - uses net/http.e to paste a euphoria file to
             http://euphoria.pastey.net

 sock_server.ex - simple socket server

 sock_client.ex - simple socket client which connects to sock_server.ex

 udp_server.ex - simple UDP server

 udp_client.ex - simple UDP client which connects to udp_server.ex
 
 bench directory   - contains a benchmark that compares the speed of Euphoria
		     against other languages.

 langwar directory - contains a real-time star wars type game
                   - runs with euid
                   
 win32 directory   - programs that require eui.exe (Windows version only)
 
 dos32 directory   - programs that require euid.exe (Windows/DOS version only)

 linux directory   - programs that require Linux/Unix
