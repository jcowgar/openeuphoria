 
 Linux-specific Demo programs
 ----------------------------
 Note: if "/lib/libc.so.6" fails, try simply: "libc.so"
 
 callc.exu - shows how to call C routines in shared libraries

 qsort.exu - shows how a C routine can call a Euphoria routine

 mylib.exu - shows how to set up your own shared library and access
             C routines and C variables from Euphoria. The source to the 
             shared library is in Mylib.c. The shared library itself is
             mylib.so. You can rebuild the shared library using:

                     gcc -shared Mylib.c -o mylib.so             
             
             You'll definitely need to do this on FreeBSD.
