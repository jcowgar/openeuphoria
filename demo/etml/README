This is an example pre-processor. The idea is to create a version of ASP
tags that supports the Euphoria language. Notice the configuration given
in the euinc.conf file is the linking magic between etml.ex and it's conversion
of example.wc.

To run this example, simply type:

eui test.ex "your name"

With the pre-processor we are able to create a fully functional template language
supporting all Euphoria syntax and use it directly in our Euphoria source via the
include command in only 47 lines of code.
