		
		DEMO Programs for the DOS32 Platform
		------------------------------------
 
 Run each program using euid.exe.
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The graphics programs use:
	
	constant GRAPHICS_MODE = 18   -- VGA graphics resolution
 
 This will provide VGA resolution, and shouldn't cause any problems.
 See include\graphics.e for other possible graphics modes. You should also
 run under DOS or in a full-screen DOS window under Windows. (Press Alt-Enter)
 
 For modes 256 and higher (SVGA), users of ATI and some other cards, may have 
 to add the following two statements at the top of the .exd file:
      include machine.e
      use_vesa(1)
 This will force the use of the VESA graphics standard for SVGA modes.

 bitmap.exd - displays bitmap (.BMP) pictures
    
 dosint.exd - some examples of calling DOS system interrupt routines
 
 hardint.exd - a hardware interrupt handler
 
 mouse.exd  - simple demo of get_mouse() built-in function
	   - you need DOS mouse support for this

 mset.exd   - Mandelbrot Set (fractal) generator
	   - Press Enter to stop the display and change all the colors
           - Press Enter again to choose a region of the M-set to zoom in on
	   - use the arrow keys to select a box to enlarge, or type 'q'
	     to quit
	   - your picture is saved in a .BMP file (suitable for wallpaper!)
 	   - it takes a few minutes as hundreds of floating-point calculations 
 	     are performed *per pixel*.
  
 plot3d.exd - 3-D surface plotting of functions 
	   - add in your own function of x and y, and see it plotted
	   - Press Enter to move on to the next sample function

 polygon.exd - displays interesting polygon patterns
	    - hit space bar to see a new pattern

 sb.exd      - bouncing balls screen blank program 

 stereo.exd - make a random dot stereo picture:
 	   - reads "picture" file by default 
 	     
 tasksort.exd - demo of 4 different sort routines running in parallel using
               Euphoria's multitasking feature

         - try to get 4 in a row, on any plane or 1 per plane
         - play against "DEFENDO" or "AGGRESSO" or a human, or
	   watch the AGGRESSO and DEFENDO algorithms slug it out
	 - you need DOS mouse support for a human to play

	 - hit space bar to freeze/restart the display
	 - Enter to quit
