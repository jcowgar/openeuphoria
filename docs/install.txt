== Installing Euphoria

Download and run the latest Euphoria setup program. It will install Euphoria on
any //Windows// system from //Windows 95// up.

After installing, see [[:What to Do | What to do next]] for ideas on how to use this package.

=== Possible Problems

* If the install appeared to run ok, but example programs are not working, did you remember
  to shut down and restart your computer?
* On //Windows XP/2000//, be careful that your ##PATH## and ##EUDIR## do not conflict with
  ##autoexec.nt##, which can also be used to set environment variables.
* On //WinME/98/95// if the install procedure fails to edit your ##autoexec.bat## file, you will have
  to do it yourself. Follow the manual procedure described below.

=== Manually editing Environment Variables

On //Windows 95/98/ME// systems, you will need to edit the autoexec.bat file to
update the environment variables before using Euphoria.

# In the file ##c:\autoexec.bat## add ##C:\EUPHORIA\BIN## to the list of directories in
  your ##PATH## command. You might use the Windows Notepad or any other
  text editor to do this. You can also go to the //Start Menu, select Run, type in ##sysedit##
  and press Enter//. ##autoexec.bat## should appear as one of the system files that you can
  edit and save.
# In the same ##autoexec.bat## file add a new line: ##SET EUDIR=C:\EUPHORIA##
# The ##EUDIR## environment variable indicates the full path to the main Euphoria directory.
# Reboot (restart) your machine. This will define your new ##PATH## and ##EUDIR## environment
  variables.

On //WinNT/2000/XP// and higher, if for some reason your ##EUDIR## and ##PATH##
variables are not set correctly, then set them in whatever way your system
allows. For example on //Windows XP// select: ##Start Menu -> Control Panel ->
Performance & Maintenance -> System -> Advanced## then click the ##Environment
Variables## button. Click the top ##New...## button then enter ##EUDIR## as the
Variable Name and ##c:\euphoria## (or whatever is correct) for the value, then
click ##OK##. Find ##PATH## in the list of your variables, select it, then
click ##Edit...##. Add ##;c:\euphoria\bin## at the end  and click ##OK##. The change will
be effective next time you open a console window, or after a computer reboot.

Some systems, such as //Windows ME//, have an ##AUTOEXEC.BAT## file, but it's a
hidden file that might not show up in a directory listing. Nevertheless it's
there, and you can view it and edit it if necessary by typing, for example:
##notepad c:\autoexec.bat## in a console window.

If you have an ##autoexec.bat## file, but it doesn't contain a ##PATH##
command, you will have to create one that includes ##C:\EUPHORIA\BIN##.

There is another, optional, environment variable used by some experienced users
of Euphoria. It is called ##EUINC## (see a
[[http://www.rapideuphoria.com/cgi-bin/guru.exu?refDoc=on&libDoc=on&otherDoc=on&keywords=euinc|Guru Search]]). It determines the search path for included files. You might want
to add it, or change it, when you install a new version of Euphoria.


=== How to Uninstall Euphoria

# If you wish to recover your previous version of Euphoria, or parts of it, the "backup"
  subdirectory contains a backup copy of each of your previous standard Euphoria
  subdirectories, plus any files that you may have added. However it does not contain any
  additional subdirectories that you may have created on your own.
# If there are no files that you need, you can delete the ##EUPHORIA## directory that you
  installed into.
# Delete the ##EUDIR## environment variable, and remove the ##EUPHORIA## directory from your
  ##PATH##, either in ##C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT##, or in ##Control Panel/System/Advanced##.
# Delete the references to EUPHORIA in your ##Start Menu##.
