.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B euc
command.

.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
The euphoria to C translator converts euphoria source code into C source
that can be compiled into native code.  The resulting executable doesn't
need the euphoria interpreter (eui) to run.  After translation, an executable
script named emake will be created in the current directory.  It contains
the commands required to compile and link the resulting C source files.  
Either stand alone executables or shared libraries can be built.  The 
shared libraries can be used by any other program, and can also be used
to pass native euphoria objects from a euphoria program that uses the
library.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-i path
Specifies an additional include path to the translator.
.TP
.B \-c path-to-euinc.conf
Specifies a configuration file to be read in to specify additional
include paths for the translator.
.TP
.B \-dll
Translates code to build a shared library.
.TP
.B \-keep
The emake script will not delete translated C source files
after it completes.
.TP
