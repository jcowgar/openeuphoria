== Installation
:<<LEVELTOC level=2 depth=4>>

To install Euphoria, consult the instructions below for your particular 
operating system.

=== Windows

To install Euphoria on //Windows//, visit the following URL:

:http://openeuphoria.org/wiki/view/DownloadEuphoria.wc

Download the lastest //Windows// installer found under the Binary Releases 
heading of the Current version of Euphoria. Run the program and follow the 
prompts to get Euphoria installed.
   
The installer copies the required files and adds ##euphoria\bin## to your path.
It also sets the environment variable **EUDIR** to the Euphoria directory.

=== Linux and FreeBSD

Euphoria may be installed using either the gzipped tarball, or from a
distribution specific package, if available.

The gzipped tarball is laid out similarly to the //Windows// directory 
structure.
You'll need to manually edit ##/etc/profile## so the ##PATH## contains
##euphoria\bin##, and either create a ##eu.cfg## file or set up ##EUDIR##
and ##EUINC##.

The packaged version installs Euphoria in a more //Unix//-like way, putting the
executables into ##/usr/bin##, ##/usr/share/euphoria## and
##/usr/share/doc/euphoria##.  Man pages for ##eui##, ##euc##, ##eub##,
##shroud## and ##bind## are also installed.  It will also create
##/etc/euphoria/eu.cfg##, which will point to the standard euphoria include
directory in ##/usr/share/euphoria/include##.

%%output=post_install
== Post Install

When installed, the ##euphoria## directory will look something like this:

* ##\euphoria##
** readme.doc
** readme.htm
** License.txt
** ##\bin## - Interpreters ##eui.exe## and ##euiw.exe##. Translator
    ##euc.exe##. Or on //Linux/FreeBSD//,
    Interpreter ##eui## and Translator ##euc##. There are also utility
    programs such as ##ed.bat##, ##guru.bat##, etc.
** ##\include## - standard include files
*** ##\include\std## - the standard Euphoria library include files, e.g.
     ##file.e##, ##sequence.e##
** ##\source## - the complete source code (interpreter, translator, binder)
** ##\docs## - plain text, man pages, html documentation files
** ##\tutorial## - small tutorial programs to help you learn Euphoria
** ##\demo## - generic demo programs that run on all platforms
*** ##\win32## - //WIN32//-specific demo programs (optional)
*** ##\unix## - //Linux/FreeBSD/OS X//-specific demo programs (optional)
*** ##\langwar## - language war game for //Linux/FreeBSD/OS X//
*** ##\bench## - benchmark programs

The //Linux// subdirectory is not included in the //Windows// distribution,
and the ##win32## subdirectories are not included in the
 //Linux/FreeBSD// distribution. In this manual, directory names are shown
 using backslash (**\**). //Linux/FreeBSD// users should substitute forward
 slash (**/**).

%%output=configuration
== Set Up the Euphoria Configuration File (eu.cfg)

Euphoria supports reading command line switches from configuration files. The 
default name for the configuration file is ##eu.cfg##. However you can specify
different ones by using the ##-C## switch.

=== Configuration file format

The configuration file is a text file. Each line in the file is either a command
line switch, a section header, an include path or a comment.
* Comments are lines that begin with a double dash {{{"--"}}}. Everything on the
line is ignored.
* A section header is a //name// enclosed in square brackets. eg. 
##[interpret]##.
** There are a number of predefined sections.
** The lines in a section are only added to the command line switches if they
 apply to the mode that Euphoria is running in.
*** [windows] Applies to Windows platform only.
*** [unix] Applies to any Unix platform only.
*** [interpret] Applies to the interpreter running in any platform.
*** [translate] Applies to the translator running in any platform.
*** [bind] Applies to the binder running in any platform.
*** [interpret:windows] Applies to the interpreter when running under //Windows// 
only.
*** [interpret:unix] Applies to the interpreter when running under //Unix// 
only.
*** [translate:windows] Applies to the translator when running under //Windows// 
only.
*** [translate:unix] Applies to the translator when running under //Unix// only.
*** [bind:windows] Applies to the binder when running under //Windows// only.
*** [bind:unix] Applies to the binder when running under //Unix// only.
*** [all] Applies to all running modes.
** All configuration lines before the first section header are assumed to be the
##[all]## section.
** You can have any number of section headers, but only the predefined ones are
used. All lines in other sections are treated as comments.
* A command line switch is a line that begins with a single dash. The entire 
line is added to the actual command line as if it was originally there.
* An include path is any other line that is not one of the above. The string 
##-I## is prepended to the line and then it is added to the command line.

=== Config File Locations

When Euphoria starts up, it looks for configuration files in the following 
order:
* For //Windows// systems
## ~%ALLUSERSPROFILE~%\euphoria\eu.cfg
## ~%APPDATA~%\euphoria\eu.cfg
## ~%EUDIR~%\eu.cfg
## ~%HOMEDRIVE~%\~%HOMEPATH~%\eu.cfg
## From where ever the executable is run from "<exepath>/eu.cfg"
## Current working directory - "./eu.cfg"
## Command line -C switches
* For //Unix// systems
## /etc/euphoria/eu.cfg
## ${EUDIR}/eu.cfg
## ${HOME}/.eu.cfg
## From where ever the executable is run from "<exepath>/eu.cfg"
## Current working directory - "./eu.cfg"
## Command line -C switches

=== Config File Notes

* Euphoria processes every configuration file found, and in the order described 
above. This means that settings specified in earlier configuration files may be 
overridden by subsequent configuration files. For example, a configuration file 
in the current directory will override the same settings in a configuration file
in the executable's directory.
* If a configuration file contains a ##-C## switch, the new configuration file
specified on that switch is processed before subsequent lines in the old file.
* A configuration file is only ever processed once. Additional references to the
same file are ignored.
