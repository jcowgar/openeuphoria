== Installation
:<<LEVELTOC level=2 depth=4>>

To install Euphoria, consult the instructions below for your particular 
operating system.

=== Windows

To install Euphoria on //Windows//, visit the following URL:

:http://openeuphoria.org/wiki/view/DownloadEuphoria.wc

Download the lastest //Windows// installer found under the Binary Releases 
heading of the Current version of Euphoria. Run the program and follow the 
prompts to get Euphoria installed.
   
The installer copies the required files and adds ##euphoria\bin## to your path.
It also sets the environment variable **EUDIR** to the Euphoria directory.

=== Linux and FreeBSD

Euphoria may be installed using either the gzipped tarball, or from a
distribution specific package, if available.

The gzipped tarball is laid out similarly to the //Windows// directory 
structure.
You'll need to manually edit ##/etc/profile## so the ##PATH## contains
##euphoria\bin##, and either create a ##eu.cfg## file or set up ##EUDIR##
and ##EUINC##.

The packaged version installs Euphoria in a more //Unix//-like way, putting the
executables into ##/usr/bin##, ##/usr/share/euphoria## and
##/usr/share/doc/euphoria##.  Man pages for ##eui##, ##euc##, ##eub##,
##shroud## and ##bind## are also installed.  It will also create
##/etc/euphoria/eu.cfg##, which will point to the standard euphoria include
directory in ##/usr/share/euphoria/include##.
