== Installation
:<<LEVELTOC level=2 depth=4>>

To install Euphoria, consult the instructions below for your particular 
operating system.

=== Windows

All versions other than Windows 95 work without problems.  To use Windows 95, it must have Internet Explorer version 4 or higher
installed (included in service pack 2.5).  To use the new socket functions you will also need fully patched versions of Windows.

EUPHORIA is frequently tested on versions Windows XP, Vista, 7.

To install Euphoria on //Windows//, visit the following URL:

:http://openeuphoria.org/wiki/view/DownloadEuphoria.wc

The "Standard" version is a complete Euphoria installation, with
Interpreter, Binder, Translator. Included are demo programs and
documentation.

The "Open Watcom" version has the contents of the "Standard" version, 
plus a bundled compiler. This is a convenient way of producing compiled executables
from Euphoria programs.

Download the latest //Windows// installer found under the Binary Releases 
heading of the Current version of Euphoria. Run the program and follow the 
prompts to get Euphoria installed.
   
The installer copies the required files; adds the binary subdirectory to 
your path, if you leave 'update environment' checked; and if you leave 
'Associate file extensions' checked, it associates icons and various actions to
EUPHORIA file extensions.  Please do not open 'Euphoria Console Files' from Explorer;
they are meant to be run from the command line.

The installer does not set the environment variable **EUDIR** to the Euphoria 
directory even though many third-party programs expect that to be set.  This is
so an older version of EUPHORIA can also still work on the same system.
You can set this environment variable in the Control Panel in 
'System and Maintenance\System' under 'Advanced Settings'.


=== Linux and FreeBSD

Euphoria may be installed using either a //Unix// archive ( ##.tar.gz## or ##.tar.bz2## ) 
or, a distribution specific package, if available.

:http://openeuphoria.org/wiki/view/DownloadEuphoria.wc

The //Unix// tarball "Archive" is laid out similarly to the //Windows// directory 
structure. This may be convenient if working cross-platform between
//Windows// and //Unix//. The files at ~SourceForge are also in this
form, making it convenient if you wish to use updates directly from
the SVN depository.

To install this version you must manually unarchive the tarball. Then
copy the files to a suitable directory.

You'll need to manually edit:
* ##/etc/profile## so the ##PATH## contains
** ##euphoria/bin##, and either create 
*** an ##eu.cfg## file or 
*** set up ##EUDIR## and ##EUINC##.

The "Packaged" version installs Euphoria in a more //Unix//-like way, putting the executables into 
* ##/usr/bin##, 
* ##/usr/share/euphoria## and
* ##/usr/share/doc/euphoria##.  
* Man pages for ##eui##, ##euc##, ##eub##, ##shroud## and ##bind## are also installed.  
* It will also create ##/etc/euphoria/eu.cfg##, which will point to the standard euphoria include
directory in ##/usr/share/euphoria/include##.

Other //Unix// based installations can be compiled from "Source Releases".

=== OS X

Look for an installation package for Apple installations.

:http://openeuphoria.org/wiki/view/DownloadEuphoria.wc

=== DOS

There is DOS support only up to Euphoria 3.1. DOS developers are 
invited to contribute their skills.

=== Nightly Builds


You have access to the latest Euphoria source-code that the Developers are
working on via the official OpenEuphoria Mercurial repository:
http://scm.openeuphoria.org

Binary files are called //Eubins//, and are automated "Nightly Builds" 
produced from the latest code in the code repository:
http://openeuphoria.org/eubins/

A complete installation requires merging the original source files,
and the contents of the eubins download. Then, the path to euphoria/bin
must be set and a cfg file must be written.

For the adventurous only.

%%output=post_install
== Post Install

The directory maps will help you locate the Euphoria executables, documentation,
and sample programs.

The default for the //Windows// installation, and optional for a 
//Unix// installation:

}}}


The //Linux// subdirectory is not included in the //Windows// distribution,
and the ##win32## subdirectories are not included in the
 //Linux/FreeBSD// distribution. In this manual, directory names are shown
 using backslash (**\**). //Linux/FreeBSD// users should substitute forward
 slash (**/**).

The "Debian Package" installs Euphoria into these directories:

{{{
|
|__ /usr/bin                       (executables: eui, euc, ... )
|       
|__ /usr/share/euphoria     
|                     |   
|                     |__ bin      (utility programs)
|                     |__ demo     (general demonstration programs)
|                     |__ include  (standard library)
|                     |__ source   (source-code for Euphoria)
|                     |__ tutorial (tutorial programs for learning Euphoria)
|
|__ /usr/share/doc/euphoria        (html and pdf documentation)
|
|__ /etc/euphoria                  ( eu.cfg )
}}}

Additionally, installing from source on a Unix-like OS will install in 
the same pattern, by default using ##/usr/local/## instead of ##/usr/##.
You can change ##/usr/local## to something else by running:
{{{
$ ./configure --prefix /some/other/location
}}}
Before building.

The "include", "demo" and "tutorial" directories are the same in
//Windows// and //Unix//.


%%output=configuration
== Set Up the Euphoria Configuration File (eu.cfg)

Euphoria supports reading command line switches from configuration files. The 
default name for the configuration file is ##eu.cfg##. However you can specify
different ones by using the ##-C## switch.

=== Configuration file format

The configuration file is a text file. Each line in the file is either a command
line switch, a section header, an include path or a comment.
* Comments are lines that begin with a double dash {{{"--"}}}. Everything on the
line is ignored.
* A section header is a //name// enclosed in square brackets. eg. 
##[interpret]##.
** There are a number of predefined sections.
** The lines in a section are only added to the command line switches if they
 apply to the mode that Euphoria is running in.
*** [windows] Applies to Windows platform only.
*** [unix] Applies to any Unix platform only.
*** [interpret] Applies to the interpreter running in any platform.
*** [translate] Applies to the translator running in any platform.
*** [bind] Applies to the binder running in any platform.
*** [interpret:windows] Applies to the interpreter when running under //Windows// 
only.
*** [interpret:unix] Applies to the interpreter when running under //Unix// 
only.
*** [translate:windows] Applies to the translator when running under //Windows// 
only.
*** [translate:unix] Applies to the translator when running under //Unix// only.
*** [bind:windows] Applies to the binder when running under //Windows// only.
*** [bind:unix] Applies to the binder when running under //Unix// only.
*** [all] Applies to all running modes.
** All configuration lines before the first section header are assumed to be the
##[all]## section.
** You can have any number of section headers, but only the predefined ones are
used. All lines in other sections are treated as comments.
* A command line switch is a line that begins with a single dash. The entire 
line is added to the actual command line as if it was originally there.
* An include path is any other line that is not one of the above. The string 
##-I## is prepended to the line and then it is added to the command line.

=== Config File Locations

When Euphoria starts up, it looks for configuration files in the following 
order:
* For //Windows// systems
## ~%ALLUSERSPROFILE~%\euphoria\eu.cfg
## ~%APPDATA~%\euphoria\eu.cfg
## ~%EUDIR~%\eu.cfg
## ~%HOMEDRIVE~%\~%HOMEPATH~%\eu.cfg
## From where ever the executable is run from "<exepath>/eu.cfg"
## Current working directory - "./eu.cfg"
## Command line -C switches
* For //Unix// systems
## /etc/euphoria/eu.cfg
## ${EUDIR}/eu.cfg
## ${HOME}/.eu.cfg
## From where ever the executable is run from "<exepath>/eu.cfg"
## Current working directory - "./eu.cfg"
## Command line -C switches

=== Config File Notes

* Euphoria processes every configuration file found, and in the order described 
above. This means that settings specified in earlier configuration files may be 
overridden by subsequent configuration files. For example, a configuration file 
in the current directory will override the same settings in a configuration file
in the executable's directory.
* If a configuration file contains a ##-C## switch, the new configuration file
specified on that switch is processed before subsequent lines in the old file.
* A configuration file is only ever processed once. Additional references to the
same file are ignored.
