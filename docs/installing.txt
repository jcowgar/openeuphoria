== Installation
:<<LEVELTOC level=2 depth=4>>

To install Euphoria, consult the instructions below for your particular 
operating system.

=== Windows

To install Euphoria on //Windows//, visit the following URL:

:http://openeuphoria.org/wiki/view/DownloadEuphoria.wc

The "Standard" version is a complete Euphoria installation, with
Interpreter, Binder, Translator. Included are demo programs and
document ion.

The "Open Watcom" version has the contents of the "Standard" version, plus a bundled compiler. This is a convenient way of producing compiled executables
from Euphoria programs.

Download the latest //Windows// installer found under the Binary Releases 
heading of the Current version of Euphoria. Run the program and follow the 
prompts to get Euphoria installed.
   
The installer copies the required files and adds ##euphoria\bin## to your path.
It also sets the environment variable **EUDIR** to the Euphoria directory.

=== Linux and FreeBSD

Euphoria may be installed using either the "gzipped tarball", or from a
distribution specific "package", if available.


:http://openeuphoria.org/wiki/view/DownloadEuphoria.wc

The "Gzipped tarball" is laid out similarly to the //Windows// directory 
structure. This may be convenient if working cross-platform between
//Windows// and //Unix//. The files at ~SourceForge are also in this
form, making it convenient if you with to use updates directly from
the SVN depository.

To install this version you must manually unarchive the tarball. Then
copy the files to a suitable directory.

You'll need to manually edit:
* ##/etc/profile## so the ##PATH## contains
** ##euphoria/bin##, and either create 
*** a ##eu.cfg## file or 
*** set up ##EUDIR## and ##EUINC##.

The "Packaged" version installs Euphoria in a more //Unix//-like way, putting the executables into 
* ##/usr/bin##, 
* ##/usr/share/euphoria## and
* ##/usr/share/doc/euphoria##.  
* Man pages for ##eui##, ##euc##, ##eub##,
* ##shroud## and ##bind## are also installed.  
* It will also create
##/etc/euphoria/eu.cfg##, which will point to the standard euphoria include
directory in ##/usr/share/euphoria/include##.


=== Mac OS X

Look for an installation package for Apple installations.

:http://openeuphoria.org/wiki/view/DownloadEuphoria.wc

=== Adventurous Install

The adventurous may install the very latest version of Euphoria.
This is a fully manual installation. It must be understood that at
any one time, a developmental version may be unstable~--it is after
all in the process of being written.

You can get access to the latest Euphoria version that the Developers are
working on.

:http://rapideuphoria.svn.sourceforge.net/

Complete source-code for Euphoria and tools (like eudoc, creolehtml)
are hosted at ~SourceForge. From there you may download a full tree
of code as one ##.tgz## file. With a SVN client, it is also 
possible to maintain a continuously updated copy of these files. A
//Windows// program like "Tortoise" does this conveniently.

For internal use, the developers have compiled binary versions of
Euphoria available for download. These are called "eubins" and are
located at:

:http://openeuphoria.org/eubins/linux/

A complete installation requires merging the original source files,
and the contents of the eubins download. Then, the path to euphoria/bin
must be set and a cfg file must be written.

Again, for the adventurous only.





%%output=post_install
== Post Install

When installed, the ##euphoria## directory will look something like this:

* ##\euphoria##
** readme.doc
** readme.htm
** License.txt
** ##\bin## - Interpreters ##eui.exe## and ##euiw.exe##. Translator
    ##euc.exe##. Or on //Linux/FreeBSD//,
    Interpreter ##eui## and Translator ##euc##. There are also utility
    programs such as ##ed.bat##, ##guru.bat##, etc.
** ##\include## - standard include files
*** ##\include\std## - the standard Euphoria library include files, e.g.
     ##file.e##, ##sequence.e##
** ##\source## - the complete source code (interpreter, translator, binder)
** ##\docs## - plain text, man pages, html documentation files
** ##\tutorial## - small tutorial programs to help you learn Euphoria
** ##\demo## - generic demo programs that run on all platforms
*** ##\win32## - //WIN32//-specific demo programs (optional)
*** ##\unix## - //Linux/FreeBSD/OS X//-specific demo programs (optional)
*** ##\langwar## - language war game for //Linux/FreeBSD/OS X//
*** ##\bench## - benchmark programs

The //Linux// subdirectory is not included in the //Windows// distribution,
and the ##win32## subdirectories are not included in the
 //Linux/FreeBSD// distribution. In this manual, directory names are shown
 using backslash (**\**). //Linux/FreeBSD// users should substitute forward
 slash (**/**).

%%output=configuration
== Set Up the Euphoria Configuration File (eu.cfg)

Euphoria supports reading command line switches from configuration files. The 
default name for the configuration file is ##eu.cfg##. However you can specify
different ones by using the ##-C## switch.

=== Configuration file format

The configuration file is a text file. Each line in the file is either a command
line switch, a section header, an include path or a comment.
* Comments are lines that begin with a double dash {{{"--"}}}. Everything on the
line is ignored.
* A section header is a //name// enclosed in square brackets. eg. 
##[interpret]##.
** There are a number of predefined sections.
** The lines in a section are only added to the command line switches if they
 apply to the mode that Euphoria is running in.
*** [windows] Applies to Windows platform only.
*** [unix] Applies to any Unix platform only.
*** [interpret] Applies to the interpreter running in any platform.
*** [translate] Applies to the translator running in any platform.
*** [bind] Applies to the binder running in any platform.
*** [interpret:windows] Applies to the interpreter when running under //Windows// 
only.
*** [interpret:unix] Applies to the interpreter when running under //Unix// 
only.
*** [translate:windows] Applies to the translator when running under //Windows// 
only.
*** [translate:unix] Applies to the translator when running under //Unix// only.
*** [bind:windows] Applies to the binder when running under //Windows// only.
*** [bind:unix] Applies to the binder when running under //Unix// only.
*** [all] Applies to all running modes.
** All configuration lines before the first section header are assumed to be the
##[all]## section.
** You can have any number of section headers, but only the predefined ones are
used. All lines in other sections are treated as comments.
* A command line switch is a line that begins with a single dash. The entire 
line is added to the actual command line as if it was originally there.
* An include path is any other line that is not one of the above. The string 
##-I## is prepended to the line and then it is added to the command line.

=== Config File Locations

When Euphoria starts up, it looks for configuration files in the following 
order:
* For //Windows// systems
## ~%ALLUSERSPROFILE~%\euphoria\eu.cfg
## ~%APPDATA~%\euphoria\eu.cfg
## ~%EUDIR~%\eu.cfg
## ~%HOMEDRIVE~%\~%HOMEPATH~%\eu.cfg
## From where ever the executable is run from "<exepath>/eu.cfg"
## Current working directory - "./eu.cfg"
## Command line -C switches
* For //Unix// systems
## /etc/euphoria/eu.cfg
## ${EUDIR}/eu.cfg
## ${HOME}/.eu.cfg
## From where ever the executable is run from "<exepath>/eu.cfg"
## Current working directory - "./eu.cfg"
## Command line -C switches

=== Config File Notes

* Euphoria processes every configuration file found, and in the order described 
above. This means that settings specified in earlier configuration files may be 
overridden by subsequent configuration files. For example, a configuration file 
in the current directory will override the same settings in a configuration file
in the executable's directory.
* If a configuration file contains a ##-C## switch, the new configuration file
specified on that switch is processed before subsequent lines in the old file.
* A configuration file is only ever processed once. Additional references to the
same file are ignored.
