== Euphoria To C Translator
:<<LEVELTOC level=2 depth=4>>

=== Introduction

The **Euphoria to C Translator** (translator) will translate any Euphoria 
program into equivalent C source code.

There are versions of the translator for //Windows// and //Unix// 
operating Systems. After translating a Euphoria program to C, you
can compile and link using one of the supported C compilers. This will give
you an executable file that will typically run much faster than if you used
the Euphoria interpreter.

The translator can translate and then compile //itself// into an executable file
for each platform. The translator is also used in translating/compiling the
front-end portion of the interpreter. The source code for the translator is in
##euphoria\source##. It is written 100% in Euphoria.

=== C Compilers Supported

The **Translator** currently works with GNU C on //Unix//-like OSes,
GNU C on //Windows// from  [[http://www.mingw.org|MinGW]]  
or [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygwin|Cygwin]] using the ##-gcc## option
and with [[http://www.openwatcom.org|Watcom C]] (the default) on //Windows//.
These are all **free** compilers.

GNU C will exist already on your //Unix// system. The others can be
downloaded from their respective Web sites.

==== Notes:

* Warnings are turned off when compiling directly or with makefiles. If you turn them 
  on, you may see some harmless messages about variables declared but not used, labels defined 
  but not used, function prototypes not declared etc.
* For the ##-gcc## option on //Windows// you will need a ##eu.a## compiled 
  with //MinGW// or //Cygwin//. The official distribution may only contain 
  ##eu.lib## compiled with //Watcom//. Also, the ##-stack## and ##-con## options 
  may not produce the expected result with //GCC C//.
* Currently, only 32-bit compilers are supported on 64-bit platforms.

=== How to Run the Translator

Running the **Translator** is similar to running the **Interpreter**:

{{{
euc -con allsorts.ex
}}}

Note: that on Unix, the demos might be installed to ##/usr/share/euphoria/demo##

Instead of running the ##allsorts.ex## program, the **Translator** will
create several C source files in a temporary build directory, compile them
and result in a native executable file. For this to work, you have to have a 
supporting compiler installed (mentioned above). The optional parameter used in this
example, ##-con##, will be explained in full detail below.

When the C compiling and linking is finished, you will have a file called ##allsorts.exe##
or simply ##allsorts## on *nix systems. The C source files will have been removed to avoid 
clutter.

When you run the ##allsorts## executable, it should run the same as if you had typed:

{{{
eui allsorts
}}}

to run it with the **Interpreter**, except that it should run faster, showing
reduced times for the various sorting algorithms in 
##euphoria\demo\allsorts.ex##.

After creating your executable file, the translator removes all the C files that were
created. If you want to look at these files, you'll need to run the translator again,
using either the ##-keep## or ##-makefile## options.

=== Command-Line Options

==== -gcc, -wat

If you happen to have more than one C compiler for a given platform, you can
select the one you want to use with a command-line option:

{{{
-wat  -- Watcom compiler
-gcc  -- GCC compiler (MinGW on Windows)
}}}

For example, to compile with GCC (or MinGW on Windows):

{{{
euc -gcc pretend.exw
}}}

Note: //Watcom// is the default on //Windows// and -wat is assumed.

==== -keep

Normally, after building your ##.exe## file, the translator will delete
all C files and object files produced by the Translator. If you want it
to keep these files, add the ##-keep## option to the Translator command-line.
e.g.

{{{
euc -keep sanity.ex
}}}

==== -dll/-so - Shared Library

To make a shared dynamically loading library, just
add ##-dll## to the command line. e.g.

{{{
euc -dll mylib.ew
}}}

Note: On *nix systems, you can also use ##-so##. Both will produce a *nix 
shared library.

Please see [[:Dynamic Link Libraries]]

==== -con - Console based program

To make a //Windows// console program instead of a //Windows// GUI program,
add ##-con## to the command line. e.g.

{{{
euc -con myprog.exw
}}}

When creating a Windows GUI program, if the ##-con## option is used, when running
your Windows program, you will have a blank console window appear and remain the duration
of your application. By default, a GUI program is assumed.

==== -rc-file - Resource File

On Windows, ##euc## can automatically compile and link in an application specific resource
file. This resource file can contain product and version information, an application icon
or any other valid resource data.

{{{
euc -rc-file myapp.rc myapp.ex
}}}

The resulting executable will contain all the resources from ##myapp.rc## compiled into 
the executable. Please see [[:Using Resource Files]].

==== -stack - Stack size

To increase or decrease the total amount of stack space reserved for your
program, add ##-stack nnnn## to the command line. e.g.

{{{
euc -stack 100000 myprog.ex
}}}

The total stack space (in bytes) that you specify will be divided up among all
the tasks that you have running (assuming you have more than one). Each task
has it's own private stack space. If it exceeds its allotment, you'll get a
run-time error message identifying the task and giving the size of its stack
space. Most non-recursive tasks can run with call stacks as small as 2000
bytes, but to be safe, you should allow more than this. A deeply-recursive
task could use a great deal of space. It all depends on the maximum levels of
calls that a task might need. At run-time, as your program creates more
simultaneously-active tasks, the stack space allotted to each task will tend
to decrease.

==== -debug - Debug mode

To compile your program with debugging information, usable with a debugger
compatible with your compiler, use the ##-debug## option:

{{{
euc -debug myapp.ex
}}}

==== -lib - User defined library

It is sometimes useful to link your translated code to a Euphoria runtime
library other than the default supplied library. This ability is probably
mostly useful for testing and debugging the runtime library itself, or to give
additional debugging information when debugging translated Euphoria code. Note
that only the default library is supplied. Use the ##-lib {library}## option:

{{{
euc -lib decu.a myapp.ex
}}}

==== -plat - Set platform

The translator has the capability of translating Euphoria code to C code for a platform
other than the host platform. This can be done with the ##-plat## option. It takes
one parameter, the platform code:
* FREEBSD
* LINUX
* OSX
* WIN
* NETBSD
* OPENBSD
* SUNOS

Use one of these options to translate code into C for the specified platform.  
The default will always be the host platform of the translator that is executed, 
so ##euc.exe## will default to //Windows//, and ##euc## will default to the platform 
upon which it was built.

The resulting output can be compiled by the appropriate compiler on the
specified platform, or, possibly a cross platform compiler, if you have
one configured.

==== -makefile/-makefile-partial - Using makefiles

You can optionally have the translator create a makefile that you can use
to build your program instead of building directly.  Using a makefile like
this can be convenient if you want or need to alter the translated C code,
or change compiling or linking options before building your program.  To
do so:

{{{
$ euc -makefile myapp.ex
Translating code, pass: 1 2 3 4  generating

3.c files were created.
To build your project, type make -f myapp.mak
}}}

Then, as the message indicates, simply type:
{{{
$ make -f myapp.mak
}}}

On Windows, when using Watcom, the message will refer to wmake, the Watcom
version of make.  On BSD platforms, you may need to use ##gmake##, as the 
generated makefiles are in GNU format, not BSD.

You can also get a partial makefile using the ##-makefile-partial## switch.
This generates a makefile that you can use to include into another makefile
for a larger project.  This is useful for including the file dependencies
for your code into the larger project.

=== Dynamic Link Libraries

Simply by adding ##-dll## (or ##-so##) to the command line, the **Translator** will build a 
shared dynamically loading library instead of an executable program.

You can translate and compile a set of useful Euphoria routines, and share
them with other people, without giving them your source. Furthermore, your
routines will likely run much faster when translated and compiled. Both
translated/compiled and interpreted programs will be able to use your library.

Only the global Euphoria procedures and functions, i.e. those declared with
the "##global##", "##public##" or "##export##" keyword, will be exported from
the shared dynamically loaded library.

Any Euphoria program, whether translated or compiled or interpreted, can link
with a Euphoria shared dynamically loading library using the same mechanism that
lets you link with a shared dynamically loading library written in C. The 
program first calls [[:open_dll]]() to open the
file, then it calls [[:define_c_func]]() or [[:define_c_proc]]() for
any routines that it wants to call. It calls these routines using [[:c_func]]()
and [[:c_proc]]().

The routine names exported from a Euphoria shared dynamically loading library 
will vary depending on which C compiler you use.

GNU C on Unix exports the names exactly as they appear in the C
code produced by the **Translator**, e.g. a Euphoria routine

{{{
global procedure foo(integer x, integer y)
}}}

would be exported as "##_0foo##" or maybe "##_1foo##" etc. The underscore and 
digit are added to prevent naming conflicts. The digit refers to the Euphoria 
file where the identifier is defined. The main file is numbered as 0. The 
include files are numbered in the order they are encountered by the compiler. 
You should check the C source to be sure.

For Watcom, the **Translator** also creates an EXPORT command, added to 
##objfiles.lnk## for each exported identifier, so ##foo()## would be exported as
"##foo##".

With Watcom, if you specify the ##-makefile## option, you can edit the 
##objfiles.lnk## file to rename the exported identifiers, or remove ones that you
don't want to export.  Then build with the generated makefile.

Having nice exported names is not critical, since the name need only appear
once in each Euphoria program that uses the shared dynamically loading library, 
i.e. in a single [[:define_c_func]]() or [[:define_c_proc]]() statement. The 
author of a shared dynamically loading library
should probably provide his users with a Euphoria include file containing the
necessary [[:define_c_func]]() and [[:define_c_proc]]() statements, and he might
even provide a set of Euphoria "wrapper" routines to call the routines in the
shared dynamically loading library.

When you call [[:open_dll]](), any top-level Euphoria statements in the shared 
dynamically loading library will be executed automatically, just like a normal 
program. This gives the
library a chance to initialize its data structures prior to the first call to
a library routine. For many libraries no initialization is required.

To pass Euphoria data (atoms and sequences) as arguments, or to receive a
Euphoria object as a result, you will need to use the following constants in
##euphoria\include\dll.e##:

<eucode>
-- Euphoria types for shared dynamically loading library arguments 
-- and return values:

global constant
    E_INTEGER = #06000004,
    E_ATOM    = #07000004,
    E_SEQUENCE= #08000004,
    E_OBJECT  = #09000004
</eucode>

Use these in ##define_c_proc##() and ##define_c_func##() just as you currently
use ##C_INT##, ##C_UINT## etc. to call C shared dynamically loading libraries.

Currently, file numbers returned by [[:open]](), and routine id's returned by
[[:routine_id]](), can be passed and returned, but the library and the main
program each have their own separate ideas of what these numbers mean. Instead
of passing the file number of an open file, you could instead pass the file
name and let the shared dynamically loading library open it. Unfortunately there
is no simple solution for passing routine id's. This might be fixed in the 
future.

A Euphoria shared dynamically loading library currently may not execute any 
multitasking operations. The Translator will give you an error message about 
this.

Euphoria shared dynamically loading library can also be used by C programs as 
long as only 31-bit integer values are exchanged. If a 32-bit pointer or integer must be 
passed, and you have the source to the C program, you could pass the value in two
separate 16-bit integer arguments (upper 16 bits and lower 16 bits), and then
combine the values in the Euphoria routine into the desired 32-bit atom.

=== Using Resource Files

When creating an executable file to deliver to your users on Windows, its best to link
in a resource file that at minimum sets your application icon but better if it sets 
product and version information.

When the resource compiler is launched by ##euc##, a single macro is defined named 
##SRCDIR##. This can be used in your resource files to reference your application source
path for including other resource files, icon files, etc...

A simple resource file to attach an icon to your executable file is as simple as:

{{{
myapp ICON SRCDIR\myapp.ico
}}}

Remember that SRCDIR will be expanded to your application source path.

A more complex resource file containing an icon and product/version information may look 
like:

{{{
1 VERSIONINFO

FILEVERSION 4,0,0,9
PRODUCTVERSION 4,0,0,9

FILEFLAGSMASK 0x3fL
FILEFLAGS 0x0L
FILEOS 0x4L
FILETYPE 0x1L
FILESUBTYPE 0x0L

BEGIN
  BLOCK "StringFileInfo"
    BEGIN
      BLOCK "040904B0"
        BEGIN
          VALUE "Comments",         "http://myapplication.com\0"
          VALUE "CompanyName",      "John Doe Computing\0"
          VALUE "FileDescription",  "Cool App\0
          VALUE "FileVersion",      "4.0.0\0"
          VALUE "InternalName",     "coolapp.exe\0"
          VALUE "LegalCopyright",   "Copyright (c) 2022 by John Doe Computing\0"
          VALUE "LegalTrademarks1", "Trademark Pending\0"
          VALUE "LegalTrademarks2", "\0"
          VALUE "OriginalFilename", "coolapp.exe\0"
          VALUE "ProductName",      "Cool Application"
          VALUE "ProductVersion",   "4.0.0\0"
        END
    END
  BLOCK "VarFileInfo"
    BEGIN
      VALUE "Translation", 0x409, 1200
    END
END

coolapp ICON SRCDIR\coolapp.ico
}}}

One other item you may wish to include is a manifest file which lets Windows know that
controls should use the new theming engines available in >= Windows XP. Simply append:

{{{
1 24 "coolapp.manifest"
}}}

to the end of your resource file. The ##coolapp.manifest## file is:

{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<assembly xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1" manifestVersion="1.0">

}}}

Version, Product and Manfiest information may change with new releases of Microsoft 
Windows. You should consult MSDN for up to date information about using resource files
with your application. [[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa380599(VS.85).aspx|MSDN About Resource Files]].

=== Executable Size and Compression

The translator does not compress your executable file.
If you want to do this we suggest you try the free
[[UPX -> http://upx.sourceforge.net]] compressor.

Large Win32Lib-based .exe's produced by the Translator can be compressed by
UPX to about 15% of their original size, and you won't notice any difference
in start-up time.

The **Translator** deletes routines that are not used, including those from
the standard Euphoria include files. After deleting unused routines, it checks
again for more routines that have now become unused, and so on. This can make
a big difference, especially with Win32Lib-based programs where a large file
is included, but many of the included routines are not used in a given
program.

Nevertheless, your compiled executable file will likely be larger than the
same Euphoria program bound with the interpreter **back-end**. This is partly
due to the **back-end** being a compressed executable. Also, Euphoria
statements are extremely compact when stored in a bound file. They need more
space after being translated to C, and compiled into machine code. Future
versions of the **Translator** will produce faster and smaller executables.

=== Interpreter vs. Translator

All Euphoria programs can be translated to C, and with just a few exceptions
noted below, will run the same as with the **Interpreter** (but hopefully
faster).

The **Interpreter** and **Translator** share the same parser, so you will get
the same syntax errors, variable not declared errors etc. with either one.


The **Interpreter** automatically expands the call stack (until memory is
exhausted), so you can have a huge number of levels of nested calls. Most C
compilers, on most systems, have a pre-set limit on the size of the stack.
Consult your compiler or linker manual if you want to increase the limit, for
example if you have a recursive routine that might need thousands of levels of
recursion. Modify the link command in your makefile, or use the ##-lflags##
option when calling the translator. For Watcom C, use ##OPTION
STACK=nnnn##, where nnnn is the number of bytes of stack space.

==== Note:

The **Translator** assumes that your program has no run-time errors in it that
would be caught by the **Interpreter**. The **Translator** does not check for:
subscript out of bounds, variable not initialized, assigning the wrong type of
data to a variable, etc.

You should **debug** your program with the **Interpreter**. The Translator
checks for certain run-time errors, but in the interest of speed, most are not
checked. When translated C code crashes you'll typically get a very cryptic
machine exception. In most cases, the first thing you should do is run your
program with the **Interpreter**, using the same inputs, and preferably with
##type_check## turned on. If the error only shows up in translated code, you
can use ##with trace## and ##trace(3)## to get a ##ctrace.out## file showing a
circular buffer of the last 500 Euphoria statements executed. If a
translator-detected error message is displayed (and stored in ##ex.err##), you
will also see the offending line of Euphoria source whenever ##with trace## is
in effect. ##with trace## will slow your program down, and the slowdown can be
extreme when ##trace(3)## is also in effect.

=== Legal Restrictions

As far as RDS is concerned, any executable programs or shared dynamically 
loading libraries that you create
with this **Translator** without modifying an RDS translator library file, may
be distributed royalty-free. You are free to incorporate any Euphoria files
provided by RDS into your application.

In general, if you wish to use Euphoria code written by 3rd parties, please
honor any restrictions that apply. If in doubt, you should ask for permission.

On //Linux//, //FreeBSD//, the GNU Library licence
will normally not affect programs created with this **Translator**. Simply
compiling with GNU C does not give the Free Software Foundation any
jurisdiction over your program. If you statically link their libraries you
will be subject to their Library licence, but the standard compile/link
procedure does not statically link any FSF libraries, so there
should be no problem.


=== Disclaimer:

This is what we believe to be the case. We are not lawyers. If it's important
to you, you should read **all** licences and the legal comments in them,
to form your own judgment. You may need to get professional legal opinion as 
well.

=== Frequently Asked Questions

==== How much of a speed-up should I expect?

It all depends on what your program spends its time doing. Programs that use
mainly integer calculations, don't call run-time routines very often, and
don't do much I/O will see the greatest improvement, currently up to about 5x
faster. Other programs may see only a few percent improvement.

The various C compilers are not equal in optimization ability.

==== What if I want to change the compile or link options in my generated makefile?

Feel free to do so, that's one reason for producing a makefile.

==== How can I make my program run even faster?

It's important to declare variables as integer where possible. In general, it
helps if you choose the most restrictive type possible when declaring a
variable.

Typical user-defined types will not slow you down. Since your program is
supposed to be free of type_check errors, types are ignored by the Translator,
unless you call them directly with normal function calls. The one exception is
when a user-defined type routine has side-effects (i.e. it sets a global
variable, performs pokes into memory, I/O etc.). In that case, if 
##with type_check## is in effect, the Translator will issue code to call the 
type routine and report any type_check failure that results.

On //Windows// we have left out the ##/ol## loop optimization for
Watcom's ##wcc386##. We found in a couple of rare cases that this option led
to incorrect machine code being emitted by the Watcom C compiler. If you add
it back in to your own makefile you might get a slight
improvement in speed, with a slight risk of buggy code.

On //Linux// or //FreeBSD// you could try the ##-O3## option of gcc instead of
##-O2##. It will "in-line" small routines, improving speed slightly, but
creating a larger executable. You could also try the
[[http://www.intel.com/cd/software/products/asmo-na/eng/compilers/clin/index.htm|Intel C~+~+ Compiler for Linux]].
It's compatible with GNU C, but some adjustments to your makefile might be required.

=== Common Problems

Many large programs have been successfully translated and compiled using each
of the supported C compilers, and the Translator is now quite stable.

==== Note:

On //Windows//, if you call a C routine that uses the cdecl calling convention
(instead of stdcall), you must specify a '##+##' character at the start of the
routine's name in [[:define_c_proc]]() and [[:define_c_func]](). If you don't,
the call may not work when running the ##eui## Interpreter.

In some cases a huge Euphoria routine is translated to C, and it proves to be
too large for the C compiler to process. If you run into this problem, make
your Euphoria routine smaller and simpler. You can also try turning off C
optimization in your makefile for just the ##.c## file that fails. Breaking up
a single constant declaration of many variables into separate constant
declarations of a single variable each, may also help. Euphoria has no limits
on the size of a routine, or the size of a file, but most C compilers do. The
Translator will automatically produce multiple small .c files from a large
Euphoria file to avoid stressing the C compiler. It won't however, break a
large routine into smaller routines.
