== Version 2.2 Beta WIN32+DOS32 December 23, 1999

Most of the new library routines developed for Euphoria 2.2 on
Linux, have now been ported to WIN32 and DOS32.
These are: sleep(), chdir(), flush(), lock_file(), unlock_file(),
crash_file(), get_screen_char() and put_screen_char(). For a
description of these routines refer to the Linux release notes below,
or <a href="library.htm">LIBRARY.DOC</a>.

Some cross-platform bug fixes and other miscellaneous improvements
were made during the Linux port. These bug fixes and improvements
have now been ported back to WIN32+DOS32. See the Linux release notes (below).

In addition, the following improvements have been made specifically
for WIN32 and DOS32:

* **exw.exe** now contains a Euphoria icon that is displayed
automatically by Windows. The icon was contributed by Gary Dumer.
Registered users may change this icon when they bind a program.
* **exw.exe** is now a compressed executable of just 73K (or so).
It's compressed using the UPX compression tool for .exe files.
* **ex.exe** has been updated with the latest release of
the CauseWay DOS extender. A problem where
CauseWay would sometimes limit you to 64Mb of memory under
some DOS configurations has been eliminated, and a few other minor
bugs were fixed.
* **bug fixed:**
The error traceback could sometimes crash or be misprinted when
a type_check failure occurred. It could only happen when 1 was added to
an expression, and the non-integer result of the expression
was assigned to a variable declared as integer.
* **bug fixed:**
If text_rows() was called as the first routine needing a WIN32 console
window, Euphoria would fail to set the new number of lines of
text on the console.
