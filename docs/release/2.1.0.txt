== Version 2.1 WIN32 + DOS32 March 29, 1999

* Updates to the **trace** screen have been optimized. Unnecessary refreshes of
  the source code, and the variables on the trace screen, have been eliminated.
  When a refresh is necessary, it is now slightly faster. This makes a noticeable
  difference in **exw.exe**, and also in **ex.exe** in pixel-graphics modes. For
  **ex.exe** in text modes, it reduces screen flicker slightly.
* The **install** program no longer requires that your PATH be less than 128
  characters. It will simply warn you if it isn't. Newer versions of DOS allow
  for a longer PATH. Thanks to Steve Adams.
* An extra error check was added to **unregister_block()** in **safe.e**. Thanks
  to David Guy.
