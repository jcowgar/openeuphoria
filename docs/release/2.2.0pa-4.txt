==  Version 2.2 pre-alpha #4 for Linux July 15, 1999:

<li>
 You can call C routines in **Linux**
  shared libraries (**.so** files). See
  **euphoria/demo/linux/callc.exu** for
  some examples.
<li>
 If your program does not output anything to the **xterm** window, 
  **exu** will not issue the "Press Enter"
  prompt.
<li>
  **All platforms: ed** now lets you recall
   previous top-line command text using **up-arrow** and **down-arrow**,
   similar to doskey in DOS and the shell history in Linux. This works with
   any strings that you type for **Esc n** (new file),
   **Esc d** (Linux command), **Esc f** (find string) or
   **Esc r** (replace string). In addition, you can now use
   **arrow keys**, **Home**, **End**, **Delete** etc. to edit
   strings before you press **Enter**. 
</ul>
