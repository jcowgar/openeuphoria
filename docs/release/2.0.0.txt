==  Version 2.0 March 25, 1998

* The install procedure has changed. The Euphoria .zip file now contains a large
  ##bundle.dat## file that contains over 100 files. This makes it easier for
  people to locate the important files: **readme.doc**, **install.bat**, etc.
  that they should look at before installing. The .zip file is also 35K smaller
  as a result.
* **shroud** will warn you to use **bind/bindw** if you try to create a shrouded
  source file with a name ending in "*.exe".
