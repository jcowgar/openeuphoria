== Version 2.2 pre-alpha #3 for Linux July 8, 1999:

<li>
 In an **xterm** window, **exu** will
  prompt you to hit **Enter** before it exits. Without this, **xterm**
  restores the screen so fast that you don't see any output or error messages.
<li>
 An internal coding change was made to Euphoria's
  **rand()** function. 
  (The algorithm has not changed.)
  Hopefully this will
  allow rand() to work on all distributions of
  **Linux**. Please let us know if
  rand() still fails.
<li>
 **ed:** The **Esc h** command will
  display the Euphoria help files. This was broken in pre-alpha#2.
<li>
 In an **xterm** window, Euphoria's
  **video_config()** now reports the correct 
  number of lines and columns - this helps
  **ed** to work much better.
  **ed** will work with the initial size of
  window in effect when **ed** starts up.
<li>
 **ed:** **F1**, **F2**, **F3**,
  **F4**, **Home**, **End**, and the **Delete** key work now in
  **xterm** (under Red Hat 5.2 at least). The other F-keys were already
  working. **PageUp/PageDown** and some other keys still don't work - feel
  free to add your own alternate keys.
<li>
 **exu** is now even smaller - just 82K.
</ul>
