== Version 4.1.0 Date TBD

== Bug Fixes


== Enhancements

* Euphoria can be built natively as a 64-bit programming language.
* Added 8-byte memory access: [[:poke8], [[:peek8s]], [[:peek8u]]
* eucoverage also outputs a file "big_routines.html" that shows covered routines
  from all files sorted by descending routine size
* Added [[:poke_pointer]] and [[:peek_pointer]]
* New [[:sizeof]] built-in for determining size of certain data types.
* [[ticket:631]] Scientific parsing code moved from the euphoria source directory and into the
  standard library.  Routines in ##std/get.e## now return the proper precision data
  based on the native platform (32 or 64 bits).
* Users can write their own debuggers and use them instead of the built in trace debugger.
* gcc builds now include -fPIC (position independent code) runtime libraries for translating
  euphoria code into shared objects.
* -lib-pic switch for translator to specify the PIC runtime library to be used
