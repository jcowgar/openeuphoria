== Version 3.0.1 November 3, 2006

This release cleans up a number of bugs and documentation errors in 3.0.0.

=== Improved Documentation

* A separate new document on [[:multitasking]] was added.
* Obsolete pre-open-source concepts in the 3.0.0 documentation were deleted or
  corrected.

=== Bug Fixes

* Euphoria-coded .dll / .so files were not working at all, due to a
  multitasking-related glitch. Thanks to Andrea Cini.\\
  \\
  Note: execution of multitasking built-in routines is currently not
  supported inside a Euphoria-coded .dll / .so.
  You'll get a compile-time error message from the
  Translator if you use the -dll option and your library source code
  contains multitasking operations. Other than that, use of
  Euphoria-coded .dll / .so files by main programs that do
  multitasking is fine.
* A text console bug was fixed.  It involved output to the screen involving tabs
  and/or wrap-around (at 80 columns). Thanks to Pete Lomax, Juergen Luethje, Matt
  Lewis.
* bind.bat, bindw.bat and shroud.bat were changed to use %EUDIR% rather than
  \EUPHORIA. Thanks to Ray Smith.
* syncolor.e now includes keywords.e (relative to euphoria\bin)
  rather than \euphoria\bin\keywords.e. Thanks to Rick Bettis.

=== C Source Code Changes

* All of the #ifdef ENCURSES code was stripped out.  We don't plan to use ncurses
  again, and this change makes parts of the source code much more readable.
* A thread5() machine language macro was added to be_execute.c This helps the
  interpreter to compile correctly with Open Watcom, avoiding a C optimizer bug.
  Thanks to Matt Lewis.
