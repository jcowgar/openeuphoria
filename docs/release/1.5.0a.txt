== Version 1.5a June 13, 1997:


<li>
 Many operations and library routines were optimized. 


<li>
   **get_key()** is
   100x faster when there is no key in the buffer.

<li>
   **get_all_palette()** is over 100x faster
   and this makes **save_screen()** much faster.

<li>
   The following routines have now been built directly into
   **ex.exe**, to avoid the overhead of
   calling machine_proc() or
   machine_func():
   **pixel()**, 
   **get_pixel()**,
   **mem_set()**,
   **mem_copy()**.

<li>
   **poke()** of a long sequence into memory,
   other than video memory, is 50% faster.

<li>
   **pixel()** is 4x faster in mode 19.

<li>
   **get_pixel()** is faster in all modes.

<li>
   **display_image()** is about 30% faster in
   most modes and up to 4x faster in mode 19, 
   because <br>pixel() is faster.

<li>
   All arithmetic and bitwise operations applied to sequences of integers are 
   now 29% faster.  

<li>
   a **&** b (concatenation) is 15% faster
   in most cases, and is dramatically faster in the case where you grow a
   very long sequence by concatenating many small sequences onto it. 

<li>
   **getc()** is 12% faster.

<li>
   **match()** is 8% faster in typical cases.

<li>
   **append()/prepend()** are 15% faster in
   many cases.

<li>
   **find()** of an integer within a
   sequence of integers is 64% faster.

<li>
   Formation of a 2-element sequence **{a,b}** is 11% faster.

<li>
   Internal copying of a shared sequence when it can no longer be shared is
   15% faster.
</ul>

</ul>
