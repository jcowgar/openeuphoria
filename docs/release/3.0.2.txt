== Version 3.0.2 February 9, 2007

This release fixes some important bugs in 3.0.1, and improves the source code documentation.

=== Bug Fixes

* **bug fixed: ** **Translator: ** Programs translated to C and compiled for
  Windows would crash if they used the new multitasking feature.  (This worked in
  3.0.0 but was broken accidentally in 3.0.1 because some stack offsets
  changed.)
* **bug fixed: ** **Interpreter: ** In fairly rare situations, the interpreter
  for Windows might crash.  This was due to a bug in load_private_block() where
  it was freeing a block of memory and then returning a pointer into that
  block.  In rare cases, a page of virtual memory might be removed from the
  heap by the Windows O/S before the block could be read.  Thanks to Andy
  Serpa, Pete Lomax, Matt Lewis, Derek Parnell, and others for helping to
  pin-point the location of the bug.
* **bug fixed: ** **Source Code: ** "\euphoria" was changed to to %EUDIR% in 4 .bat
  files in the source directory. Thanks to Jaime Marcos.

=== Improved Documentation

* A new document (translator.doc) was added to euphoria\source. It describes
  the internals of the Translator, with emphasis on the many optimizations
  that the Translator performs.
* The user documentation was also improved in a few places.

=== C Source Code Changes

* Matthew Lewis added a Linux/FreeBSD make file, and made source code
  changes to better support Open Watcom and a newer version of GCC.
