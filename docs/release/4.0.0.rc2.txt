== Version 4.0.0 Release Candidate 2 (Scheduled for November 18th, 2010)

=== Deprecation:

* ##[[:find_from]]## and ##[[:match_from]]## have been deprecated. ##[[:find]]## and ##[[:match]]## 
  accept an optional argument (##start##) allowing these functions to be a 100% drop in
  replacement.

=== Removed

* ##mouse.e## and ##std/mouse.e## [[ticket:376]]

=== Bug Fixes:

* [[ticket:338]], Fixed //Data Execution Prevention// for FreeBSD systems.
* [[ticket:339]], Fixed locale for FreeBSD systems.
* [[ticket:341]], Removed unused variables in the standard library.
* [[ticket:345]], Forward patches now update the stack space for a routine when
                  they create temps.
* [[ticket:352]], A function with a defaulted parameter that is both forward
                  referenced and inlined no longer crashes.
* [[ticket:358]], The programs eutest, creolehtml, and eudoc now all support a
                  command line option to display their version number.
* [[ticket:362]], The handing of regular expressions which match the text but
                  didn't have any matching sub-groups was not correct nor
                  documented.
* [[ticket:366]], Created a new module, base64, to implement the standard
                  Base-64 encoding algorithms.
* [[ticket:367]], ##[[:http_post]]## properly handles multi-part form data.
* [[ticket:372]], When an application ends, it closes all the opened files. 
                  However if it was ending due to an syntax error, it was
                  closing those files before trying to access the message 
		  text database that had been opened, thus causing a seek() to fail
                  and crash the application.
* [[ticket:378]], On Linux and FreeBSD, the socket tests failed to detect the
                  correct error code.
* [[ticket:392]], ##[[:seek]]## was not returning the correct failure code on
                  some errors.
* [[ticket:396]], Continue operations are now properly back patched.
* [[ticket:391]], Watcom build system was lacking the ability to build the manual.
* [[ticket:118]], ##object()## tests now function properly when translated.
* [[ticket:169]], ##[[:find_nested]]## no longer defaults the ##rtn_id## parameter
                  to ##-1## as that is the "invalid" return value of [[:routine_id]]
                  in which case a typo in your routine id would be silently ignored
* [[ticket:335]], ##eui## now only accepts -v, ~-~-version as parameters to display
                  the version number instead of -v, ~-~-v, -version and ~-~-version.
* Too numerous to list: Many documentation typo, spelling mistakes and formatting
  errors have been corrected.
* [[ticket:402]], ##[[:maybe_any_key]]## now works when run from the command line version
  of EUPHORIA even when run without a command-line shell.

=== Enhancements/Changes:

* [[ticket:334]], OS/X, FreeBSD and Linux distribution build scripts are now
                  combined for easier maintenance.
* [[ticket:371]], ##remove_all## has been removed as it was a duplicate of the
                  more powerful [[:match_replace]] routine.
* [[ticket:341]], [[ticket:344]], Many unused variables have been cleaned up in the 
                  standard library.
* ##manual-upload## target was added to GNU and Watcom makefiles
