== Version 4.0.0 Release Candidate 2 (Release Date TBD)

=== Deprecation

* ##[[:find_from]]## and ##[[:match_from]]## have been deprecated. ##[[:find]]## and 
  ##[[:match]]## accept an optional argument (##start##) allowing these functions to be a
  100% drop in replacement.

=== Removed

* [[ticket:376]], ##mouse.e## and ##std/mouse.e##
* Support for alternate style eu.cfg sections, i.e. bind:unix and unix:bind were 
  previously supported, now only the documented method: bind:unix is accepted.

=== Bug Fixes

* [[ticket:118]], ##object()## tests now function properly when translated.
* [[ticket:169]], ##[[:find_nested]]## no longer defaults the ##rtn_id## parameter
                  to ##-1## as that is the "invalid" return value of [[:routine_id]]
                  in which case a typo in your routine id would be silently ignored
* [[ticket:335]], ##eui## now only accepts -v, ~-~-version as parameters to display
                  the version number instead of -v, ~-~-v, -version and ~-~-version.
* [[ticket:338]], Fixed //Data Execution Prevention// for FreeBSD systems.
* [[ticket:339]], Fixed locale for FreeBSD systems.
* [[ticket:341]], Removed unused variables in the standard library.
* [[ticket:345]], Forward patches now update the stack space for a routine when
                  they create temps.
* [[ticket:352]], A function with a defaulted parameter that is both forward
                  referenced and inlined no longer crashes.
* [[ticket:358]], The programs eutest, creolehtml, and eudoc now all support a
                  command line option to display their version number.
* [[ticket:362]], The handing of regular expressions which match the text but
                  didn't have any matching sub-groups was not correct nor
                  documented.
* [[ticket:366]], Created a new module, base64, to implement the standard
                  Base-64 encoding algorithms.
* [[ticket:367]], ##[[:http_post]]## properly handles multi-part form data.
* [[ticket:372]], When an application ends, it closes all the opened files. 
                  However if it was ending due to an syntax error, it was
                  closing those files before trying to access the message 
                  text database that had been opened, thus causing a seek() to fail
                  and crash the application.
* [[ticket:378]], On Linux and FreeBSD, the socket tests failed to detect the
                  correct error code.
* [[ticket:392]], ##[[:seek]]## was not returning the correct failure code on
                  some errors.
* [[ticket:396]], Continue operations are now properly back patched.
* [[ticket:391]], Watcom build system was lacking the ability to build the manual.
* [[ticket:402]], ##[[:maybe_any_key]]## now works when run from the command line version
                  of EUPHORIA even when run without a command-line shell.
* [[ticket:457]], cmd_parse() now correctly honors the NO_HELP option and allows
                  the coder to override the default help switches.
* Too numerous to list: Many documentation typo, spelling mistakes and formatting
  errors have been corrected.
* Removed many unnecessary ##[[:maybe_any_key]]## uses from the general demos
* [[ticket:409]], Calls to ##Head()## that should have altered the sequence in place
                  did not, resulting in slower code.
* [[ticket:343]], Resolution of unqualified symbols from other files is deferred until
                  all files that could cause symbol resolution conflicts have been read.
* [[ticket:349]], Fixed resolution of qualified public symbols when the namespace points
                  to the wrong file, but the namespace file directly includes the file with
                  the actual routine
* [[ticket:425]], Fixed crash when branches were inlined into the top level
* [[ticket:426]], Eutest uses binary binder
* [[ticket:429]], ##tokenize.e## no longer drops the first character of a backtick string
* [[ticket:431]], ##tokenize.e## properly parses \xXX escapes
* [[ticket:434]], ##tokenize.e## no longer strips leading zeros on numbers when using
                  the ##[[:string_numbers]]## option.
* [[ticket:435]], ##tokenize.e## handles 0?NN numbers properly now. Returns 
                  ##[[:T_NUMBER]]## as the token type and either ##[[:TF_INT]]##
                  or ##[[:TF_HEX]]## as the form. If ##[[:string_numbers]]## is
                  enabled, the prefix is returned as part of the string, i.e.
                  {{{integer a = 0b0101}}} will return ##"0b0101"##.
* [[ticket:439]], ##tokenize.e## fixed breakage with slice operator due to new string
                  number parsing.
* ##net/http.e## now properly handles ##{ {key,value}, ...}##, ##{ encoding_type, {key,val}, ...}##
  and already encoded string data, ##"name=John%20Doe"##.
* [[ticket:417]], Accidental inclusion of TOC was removed
* [[ticket:418]], ##-debug## ##eu.cfg## switch text was corrected
* [[ticket:418]], Clarified what (all) and (translator) means
* [[ticket:448]], Fixed ##splice()## translation.
* [[ticket:453]], Reworked the way open files are cleaned up so that coverage works properly
* The euphoria coded backend (eu.ex) in some cases did not handle recursive calls correctly.

=== Enhancements/Changes

* [[ticket:334]], OS/X, FreeBSD and Linux distribution build scripts are now
                  combined for easier maintenance.
* [[ticket:341]], [[ticket:344]], Many unused variables have been cleaned up in the 
                  standard library.
* [[ticket:371]], ##remove_all## has been removed as it was a duplicate of the
                  more powerful [[:match_replace]] routine.
* ##manual-upload## target was added to GNU and Watcom makefiles
* Formatted ##buzz.ex## example
* ##euc## will always remove it's temporary build directory unless the ##-keep##
  option is supplied. If one wants to keep the build directory for some reason, they
  sould probably use ##-build-dir## as well, for example:
  {{{
  euc -build-dir my-build hello.ex
  }}} which will automatically keep the build directory since it was user specified.
* Converted ##bin/lines.ex## to use new language constructs and the standard library
  as an example of how an application take advantage of 4.0. Code base went from 591
  lines of code to 195 lines of code. Bugs were fixed, comment percentage calculations
  and header/footer lines were added in the new, smaller version as well.
* Moved network demos from ##demos/## to ##demos/net## for better organization.
* ##euphoria/tokenize.e## BLANK concept has changed. tokenize use to consume all newlines
  and only report double blanks. It now simply tokenizes the data and returns a newline
  if requested. ##keep_blanks## has been renamed to ##[[:keep_newlines]]## and 
  ##T_BLANK## has been renamed to ##[[:T_NEWLINE]]##. Thus the tokenizer doesn't perform
  any 'parser' functions, it simply tokenizes the source.
* Added ##show_tokens##, ##token_names## and ##token_forms## to ##euphoria/tokenize.e## to
  help in debugging both tokenize internal routines and applications that make use of
  ##euphoria/tokenize.e##
* Installer now creates a eu.cfg directory in EUDIR/bin
* Speed improvements to map:put()
* Demoted several "bin" programs to demos including:
** ##ascii.ex##
** ##eprint.ex##
** ##eused.ex##
** ##guru.ex##
** ##key.ex##
** ##search.ex##
** ##where.ex##
* All demos and bundled bin programs are unit tested to ensure at least eui -test passes
* Removed ##analyze.ex## as it never was a finished, deployable product
* eu.cfg "win32" sections ([win32], [bind:win32], [translate:win32], [bind:win32]) have
  now all been changed to "windows", not "win32"
* Removed demo/demo.doc and instead included in the header of each demo program what
  they do and included them into a section in the manual about demos.
* ##-test## parameter now displays warnings as well as errors
