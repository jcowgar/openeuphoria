== Version 4.0.0 Release Candidate 2 (Scheduled for November 18th, 2010)

=== Deprecation:

* ##[[:find_from]]## and ##[[:match_from]]## have been deprecated. ##[[:find]]## and ##[[:match]]## 
  accept an optional argument (##start##) allowing these functions to be a 100% drop in
  replacement.

=== Removed

* ##mouse.e## and ##std/mouse.e## [[ticket:376]]

=== Bug Fixes:

* [[ticket:341]], Removed unused variables in the standard library.
* [[ticket:367]], ##[[:http_post]]## properly handles multi-part form data.
* [[ticket:372]], When an application ends, it closes all the opened files. However
                  if it was ending due to an syntax error, it was closing those
                  files before trying to access the already opened message text database,
                  thus causing a seek() to fail and crash the application.
* [[ticket:392]], ##[[:seek]]## was not returning the correct failure code on some errors.
