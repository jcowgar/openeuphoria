	or from not declared in the file you specify (via a namespace), or not a builtin.  When declared more than once, you are now
	told where the symbols were declared.
* [[ticket:602]] socket create documentation corrected to state that it returns an error code on failure.
* [[ticket:672]] fixed dll creation under Windows.
* [[ticket:687]] fixed source file distribution.
* [[ticket:681]] fixed error reporting when the error is the last symbol on a line, but that might be part of
  and expression that carries over to the next line

* [[ticket:699]] Include public and export symbols in ex.err output
* [[ticket:717]] Fix docs to correctly describe bitwise functions
* [[ticket:725]] Smarter reading of command line options.  Euphoria could consume switches meant for the
  the end user program
* When there is a user supplied library, the translator does not abort when the library doesn't exist and one of 
  ##-nobuild##, ##-makefile## or ##-makefile-partial## is used
* [[ticket:728]] Fix sequence slice error when invalid command line arguments are passed to euphoria. 
* [[ticket:730]] Fixed initialization of private variables.  The translator incorrectly assumed that all
