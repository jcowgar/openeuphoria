== Version 4.0.4 Release Date TBD

=== Bug Fixes

* [[ticket:664]] Symbol resolution errors now report whether you use a symbol is not declared or is declared more than once, 
	or from not declared in the file you specify (via a namespace), or not a builtin.  When declared more than once, you are now
	told where the symbols were declared.
* [[ticket:602]] socket create documentation corrected to state that it returns an error code on failure.
* [[ticket:672]] fixed dll creation under Windows.
* [[ticket:681]] fixed error reporting when the error is the last symbol on a line, but that might be part of
  and expression that carries over to the next line
* [[ticket:694]] do not short circuit inside of forward function calls
