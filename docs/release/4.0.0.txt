=== Deprecation

=== Removed

=== Bug Fixes

* [[ticket:438]], removed path test in ##demos/santiy.ex## as it does not function 
                  correctly with bound, translated or even a non-standard eui location and
                  actually cannot, thus it was removed.
* [[ticket:514]], fixed bug with internal ##dir## implementation that would prevent displaying
                  the content of a directory if given without a trailing slash on Windows.
* [[ticket:517]], added a bounds check that could cause the translator or binder to crash
* Fix backend and interpreter to avoid "press any key" prompts when running as
  a console from a shared console window.

=== Enhancements/Changes

* Made previously private method ##iscon## in ##std/console.e## a public method named
  ##[[:has_console]]## which will return TRUE/FALSE if the current application has a
  console window attached
* ##[[:cmd_parse]]## now splits onto two lines an option whose command is longer than
  the maximum pad size and its description.
