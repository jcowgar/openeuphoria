== Version 4.0.0 (Release Date Scheduled December 22, 2010)

4.0.0 has not yet been released. These changes are available in the latest SVN trunk. 
4.0.0 is scheduled to be released on December 22, 2010.

For a concise list of what has changed from 3.1.1 to 4.0.0 final, please see 
[[:What's new in 4.0?]] section of this manual.

!!=== Deprecation

=== Removed

* ##creolehtml## is no longer shipped with Euphoria. It has been enhanced to support
  multiple output formats and thus its name has been changed to simply ##creole##. HTML
  remains the default output. Usage remains the same thus simply renaming build systems
  to use ##creole## instead of ##creolehtml## will work.

=== Bug Fixes

* [[ticket:438]], removed path test in ##demos/santiy.ex## as it does not function
                  correctly with bound, translated or even a non-standard eui location and
                  actually cannot, thus it was removed.
* [[ticket:514]], fixed bug with internal ##dir## implementation that would prevent displaying
                  the content of a directory if given without a trailing slash on Windows.
* [[ticket:517]], added a bounds check that could cause the translator or binder to crash.
* [[ticket:518]], Prevented write_coverage from being called twice on CTRL+C/error condition.
* [[ticket:519]], preproc and net demos are now in the debian package.
* [[ticket:530]], ##t_command_line_quote## test fixed on Windows.
* [[ticket:533]], Debian package copyright was updated in accordance to Debian policy.
* [[ticket:540]], ##[[:get_key]]## was described in both ##io.e## and ##console.e##, removed
                  from ##io.e##
* [[ticket:545]], ##[[:canonize_path]]## did not properly insert the drive letter on Windows
                  when the path began with a forward slash ##/##.
* [[ticket:548]], Fixed error in emitted C in some translated ##for## loops.
* [[ticket:550]], Examples for regex ##[[:matches]]## and ##[[:all_matches]]## now properly
                  either supply or use the default ##from## parameter.
* Fix backend and interpreter to avoid "press any key" prompts when
running as a console from a shared console window.
* Ensure forward type checks aren't resolved until after the variable being type checked has
been resolved.
* [[ticket:555]] Fixed parsing of constants when first statement is a constant assigned by a
                 built-in function.

=== Enhancements/Changes

* Made previously private method ##iscon## in ##std/console.e## a public method named
  ##[[:has_console]]## which will return TRUE/FALSE if the current application has a
  console window attached.
* ##[[:cmd_parse]]## now splits onto two lines an option whose command is longer than
  the maximum pad size and its description.
* PDF documentation is now much better, generated from LaTeX sources.
* Bundled ##creole## program supports multiple output formats now, the addition of LaTeX
  for great printed or PDF documentation from your creole sources.
* Bundled utility ##bench.ex## now outputs timing information to STDERR
  by default. ##--stdout## can be supplied if output to STDOUT is desired. It now also
  displays the min and max iteration times in addition to the already average and total.
