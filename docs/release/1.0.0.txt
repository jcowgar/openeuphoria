== Version 1.0 July 1993

Euphoria was first released after 3 years of research and development
and 6 months of Beta testing. Many of the ideas behind Euphoria came
from Robert Craig's Master's Thesis in Computer Science at the University
of Toronto. That thesis was strongly influenced by the work of John Backus
on functional programming (FP) languages.
