== Version 2.1 Beta March 5, 1999

* The rest of the files in the **euphoria\doc** directory have now been converted
  to HTML. Every **.doc** file in the **doc** directory now has a corresponding
  **.htm** file in the **euphoria\html** directory. Many improvements and
  clarifications were made to the documentation.
* You will now be warned when you have code that comes immediately after an
  **exit**, **return** or **abort()** statement. This code can never be executed.
  Suggested by Gabriel Boehme.
* **safe.e** no longer includes **graphics.e**. This eliminates possible naming
  conflicts when **safe.e** is substituted for **machine.e**.
* Using code supplied by David Guy, **safe.e** will now let you add or remove
  externally-allocated blocks of memory on the "safe address list". **See the new
  library routines:** **register_block()** and **unregister_block()**.
* **message_box()** now uses the **handle of the active window** rather than
  NULL. This forces the user to reply to your message before he can continue to
  interact with your program.  He won't be prevented from interacting with other
  programs. Thanks to Austin C.
* **get()** and **value()** have been sped up by a further 5% thanks to Gabriel
  Boehme.
* **exw.exe** has been made less likely to crash mysteriously when attacked by a
  virus.
* **sanity.ex** now checks your installation of Euphoria. You'll be warned if
  your PATH or EUDIR variables are not set, or your **ex.exe**, **exw.exe**,
  **pdex.exe**, or **pdexw.exe** files have been corrupted or not installed
  correctly in **euphoria\bin**.
* The security of **bound** and **scrambled** programs has been tightened some
  more. Thanks to Rusty Davis.
* To save space in **euphor21.zip**, the **install** program now //generates//
  the HTML and DOC files from a common source, using Junko Miura's
  **documentation generator**. In the process, the generator is deleted, but you
  can download it from the RDS site.
* When a **type_check** failure occurs you'll be warned if the type erroneously
  returned a //sequence// for it's "true/false" result. Previously, a sequence
  result was simply reported as a type_check failure. Suggested by Ralf
  Nieuwenhuijsen.
* The code for **demo\win32\winwire.exw** was cleaned up considerably.
* The **install** program will warn you to change your **autoexec.bat** file when
  you install a new release of Euphoria onto a //different// drive.
