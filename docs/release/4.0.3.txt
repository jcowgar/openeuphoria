== Version 4.0.3 Release Date TBD

=== Bug Fixes

* [[ticket:655]] Integer values stored as doubles weren't being correctly
  coerced back to euphoria integers in translated code.
* [[ticket:656]] Translated ##[[:not_bits]]## made incorrect type assumptions
* [[ticket:662]] Switches with all integer cases, but with a range of greater than
  1024 between the biggest and smallest were interpreted incorrectly.
* [[ticket:661]] fixed translator linking to use comctl32 library on windows
* [[ticket:663]] Translator ##-plat## switch now uses ##WINDOWS## instead of ##WIN##.
* [[ticket:666]] fixed to allow integers stored as doubles in be_sockets.c.
* [[ticket:667]] Fixed optimization of translated IF when the conditions were known
  to be false.
* [[ticket:665]] Fixed to load socket routines from its DLL only when needed.  Created programs 
 will not need sockets installed except for programs created with GNU-C.

=== Enhancements

* Minor changes to eutest output to read its console output
* The interpreter and programs created with the translator (for WATCOM only) will now run on older versions of Windows that don't support
  sockets unless this program //uses// sockets.
