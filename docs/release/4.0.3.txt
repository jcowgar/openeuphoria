=== Bug Fixes

* [[ticket:655]] Integer values stored as doubles weren't being correctly
  coerced back to euphoria integers in translated code.
* [[ticket:656]] Translated ##[[:not_bits]]## made incorrect type assumptions
* [[ticket:662]] Switches with all integer cases, but with a range of greater than
  1024 between the biggest and smallest were interpreted incorrectly.
* [[ticket:661]] fixed translator linking to use comctl32 library on windows
* [[ticket:663]] Translator ##-plat## switch now uses ##WINDOWS## instead of ##WIN##.
* [[ticket:666]] fixed to allow integers stored as doubles in be_sockets.c.
* [[ticket:654]] removed internal use-only standard library routines and constants from the user documentation.

=== Enhancements

* Minor changes to eutest output to read its console output

  sockets unless this program //uses// sockets.
* New math functions ##[[:larger_of]]## and ##[[:smaller_of]]##
