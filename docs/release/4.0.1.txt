== Version 4.0.1 Date TBD

== Bug Fixes

* Renamed implicit Top Level SubProgram to an illegal name.  Previously used "_toplevel_",
  which became a legal name for euphoria 4.0
* [[ticket:577]] ##object()## works same on translator as the interpreter.
* [[ticket:575]] OW installer file setenv-ow.bat functionality restored from 4.0.0RC2.
* case issues were removed from pathinfo(), canonical_path(), and abbreviate_path()
  these functions now return raw OS output; it is up to the user to change case when necessary

== Enhancements

* Added parsing of two digit years to ##std/datetime.e## ##[[:parse]]##.
* [[ticket:516]] added ##[[:join_path]]## and ##[[:split_path]]## routines.
* ##[[:current_dir]]()## now always returns an upper case letter for the drive
  id.

== Deprecated

* ##[[:canonical_path]]()##'s third parameter, ##no_case##, has been deprecated. If you are doing
  path comparisons on windows, use lower() or upper() instead of using the ##no_case##
  parameter.
