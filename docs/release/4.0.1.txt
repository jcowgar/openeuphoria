== Version 4.0.1 Date TBD

== Bug Fixes

* Renamed implicit Top Level SubProgram to an illegal name.  Previously used "_toplevel_",
  which became a legal name for euphoria 4.0
* [[ticket:577]] ##object()## works same on translator as the interpreter.
* [[ticket:575]] OW installer file setenv-ow.bat functionality restored from 4.0.0RC2.
* case issues were removed from pathinfo(), canonical_path(), and abbreviate_path()
  these functions now return raw OS output; it is up to the user to change case when necessary
* [[ticket:593]] Atoms represented as doubles, but that hold the double representation of a
  euphoria integer, now hash as though they were actually represented as an integer.  This
  ensures that two objects that evaluate as ##equal()## will have the same hash value.
* [[ticket:597]] Invalid negative routine ids were not detected properly by the interpreter,
  leading to a machine crash.
* Now EUPHORIA can be installed under the Windows' 'Program Files' (with spaces) and the
  translated code will be compiled.
* Fixed Demos to not rely on EUDIR being set and to not issue warnings
* Improved confirmation in the algorithm that determines where EUPHORIA is.
* [[ticket:601]] Missing htmldoc added to Makefile
* [[ticket:604]] Uninstaller now completely cleans up after the installer. 
  Note %EUBIN%\bin\eu.cfg is left  in place if modified.
* Fixed link to PDF documentation
* Added HTML documentation
* [[ticket:610]] Euphoria Installer that includes Watcom will now prevent the user from
  installing Euphoria under a directory with spaces.  Watcom itself has a lot of problems
  when spaces are in its path
* [[ticket:614]] maybe_any_key() was not pausing when a Console Program was run from 
  Windows Explorer.
* [[ticket:591]] updated copyright and version and added documentation reminding us
  all of the places we need to change that information.
* [[ticket:607]] Fixed translation of integers with decimals (e.g., 2.0) when
  assigned to constants
* [[ticket:598]] Link windows binaries to comdlg32.dll to make sure GUI calls work
  with the new manifest.
* [[ticket:590]] Fixed outdated or incorrect documentation on loop statements
* [[ticket:594]] Fixed problem with not being able to link to resource file in a 
  location with spaces.
* [[ticket:615]] Fixed abbreviate_path for Windows 
* [[ticket:595]] When it is necessary, tell user to change directory before using the make program.
* [[ticket:592]] eu.cfg files in the program's directory and the euphoria executable directories
  are searched before platform specific directories
* [[ticket:609]] Scientific notation not handling a decimal of all zeroes correctly.
* [[ticket:621]] Add ##-eudir <dir>## handler to binder and shrouder
* [[ticket:617]] Fix top level ##case## values when referencing an unqualified constant
  in another file
* [[ticket:620]] Added comdlg32.dll to mingw linking flags
* [[ticket:625]] Negative subscripts result in runtime errors.

== Enhancements

* Added parsing of two digit years to ##std/datetime.e## ##[[:parse]]##.
* [[ticket:516]] added ##[[:join_path]]## and ##[[:split_path]]## routines.
* ##[[:current_dir]]()## now always returns an upper case letter for the drive
  id.

== Deprecated

* ##[[:canonical_path]]()##'s third parameter, ##no_case##, has been deprecated. If you are doing
  path comparisons on windows, use lower() or upper() instead of using the ##no_case##
  parameter.
