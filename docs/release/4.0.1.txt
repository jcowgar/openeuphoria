== Version 4.0.1 Date TBD

== Bug Fixes

* Renamed implicit Top Level SubProgram to an illegal name.  Previously used "_toplevel_",
  which became a legal name for euphoria 4.0
* [[ticket:577]] ##object()## works same on translator as the interpreter.
* [[ticket:575]] OW installer file setenv-ow.bat functionality restored from 4.0.0RC2.
* case issues were removed from pathinfo(), canonical_path(), and abbreviate_path()
  these functions now return raw OS output; it is up to the user to change case when necessary

== Enhancements

* Added parsing of two digit years to ##std/datetime.e## ##[[:parse]]##.
* [[ticket:516]] added ##[[:join_path]]## and ##[[:split_path]]## routines.

== Deprecated

* canonical_path() no longer uses its third parameter (no_case) for case sensitivity; the no_case
  parameter will be removed in 4.1
