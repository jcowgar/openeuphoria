== Version 4.0.1 Date TBD

== Bug Fixes

* Renamed implicit Top Level SubProgram to an illegal name.  Previously used "_toplevel_",
  which became a legal name for euphoria 4.0
* [[ticket:577]] ##object()## works same on translator as the interpreter.
* euc now uses quotes around filenames when processing resource files
* [[ticket:575]] OW installer file setenv-ow.bat functionality restored from 4.0.0RC2.
* case issues were removed from pathinfo(), canonical_path(), and abbreviate_path()
  these functions now return raw OS output; it is up to the user to change case when necessary
* [[ticket:593]] Atoms represented as doubles, but that hold the double representation of a
  euphoria integer, now hash as though they were actually represented as an integer.  This
  ensures that two objects that evaluate as ##equal()## will have the same hash value.
* [[ticket:597]] Invalid negative routine ids were not detected properly by the interpreter,
  leading to a machine crash.

== Enhancements

* Added parsing of two digit years to ##std/datetime.e## ##[[:parse]]##.
* [[ticket:516]] added ##[[:join_path]]## and ##[[:split_path]]## routines.
* ##[[:current_dir]]()## now always returns an upper case letter for the drive
  id.

== Deprecated

* ##[[:canonical_path]]()##'s third parameter, ##no_case##, has been deprecated. If you are doing
  path comparisons on windows, use lower() or upper() instead of using the ##no_case##
  parameter.
