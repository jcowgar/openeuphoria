== Licensing

This product is free and open source, and has benefited from the contributions
of many people. You have complete royalty-free rights to distribute any
Euphoria programs that you develop. You are also free to distribute the 
interpreter, backend and even translator. You can ##shroud## or ##bind## 
your program and distribute the resulting files royalty-free.

You may incorporate any Euphoria source files from this package into your
program, either "as is" or with your modifications. (You will probably need at
least a few of the standard ##euphoria\include## files  in any large program).

We would appreciate it if you told people that your program was developed using
Euphoria, and gave them the address: [[http://www.openeuphoria.org/]] of our
Web page, but we do not require any such acknowledgment.

Icon files, such as ##euphoria.ico## in ##euphoria\bin##, may be distributed
with or without your changes.

The high-speed version of the Euphoria Interpreter back-end is written in ANSI
C, and can be compiled with many different C compilers. The complete source
code is in ##euphoria\source##, along with ##execute.e##, the alternate,
Euphoria-coded back-end. The generous Open Source License allows both
personal and commercial use, and unlike many other open source
licenses, your changes do not have to be made open source.

Some additional 3rd-party legal restrictions might apply when you use the
[[:Euphoria To C Translator]].
