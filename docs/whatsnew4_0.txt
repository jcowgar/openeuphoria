* Binary, Octal and an alternative Hexadecimal number format - ##0b10 (2), 0t10 (8), 0x10 (16)##
* Hexadecimal string formats. Use ##\x## to embed any byte value into a standard string,
  or create an entire hexadecimal byte string using ##x" ... "##
* Function results can now be ignored.
* Optional list terminator. The final item in a list can be the dollar symbol (##$##).
  This is just a place holder for the //end-of-list//, making it easier to
  add and delete items from the source code without having to adjust the commas.
