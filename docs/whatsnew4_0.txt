== What's new in 4.0?

**CAUTION**: serious work in progress

Euphoria v4.0 is a very large jump in functionality from the previous stable release, 3.1.1.

Euphoria has a brand new standard library consisting of over 800 public members.
Too numerous to list here, please see the reference section of this manual.

=== General Changes

* New online manual
* New logo
* Switched to using our own ticket system
* Switched to using our own self hosted Mercurial SCM system

=== Language Enhancements

* Conditional compilation using the ##ifdef## directive.
* Raw strings, which can include multilined text.
* Multiline comments using the C-styled comments ##/* .. */##, which can be nested.
* Binary, Octal and an alternative Hexadecimal number format - ##0b10 (2), 0t10 (8), 0x10 (16)##
* Hexadecimal string formats. Use ##\x## to embed any byte value into a standard string,
  or create an entire hexadecimal byte string using ##x" ... "##
* Function results can now be ignored.
* Optional list terminator. The final item in a list can be the dollar symbol (##$##).
  This is just a place holder for the //end-of-list//, making it easier to
  add and delete items from the source code without having to adjust the commas.
* Enumerated values/types (enum, enum type)
* Built-in eu: [[:namespace]]
* Declare variable anywhere, not just at the top of a method. 
* Scoped variables (declared inside an if for example)
* Assign on declaration. You can now declare a variable and assign it an initial value on the same statement.
* The ##[[:object]]()## built-in function can now be used to safely test if a variable has been initialized or not.
* Forward referencing. You no longer need to lexically declare a routine before using it.
* Additional loop constructs ...
** [[:loop]]/[[:until]]
** You can label a loop 
** while X with [[:entry]]
** [[:exit]], [[:continue]], [[:retry]]. All with an optional "label" 
** goto
* Additional conditional constructs
** Switch statement with or without [[:fallthru]]
** You can label an if or switch
** ##break## keyword allows exiting from ##[[:if]]## / ##[[:switch]]## blocks
* Default/optional parameters for routines
* Additional scope modifiers
** [[:export]]
** [[:public]] (public include)
** [[:override]]
* Built in sockets
* Built in regular expressions
* Resource clean up that can be triggered manually, or when an object's reference count goes to zero
* Automatic inlining of small routines
* Built in, optimized sequence operations (##[[:remove]]##, ##[[:insert]]##, ##[[:splice]]##, 
  ##[[:replace]]##, ##[[:head]]##, ##[[:tail]]##)
* Built in peek and poke 2 byte values, 1 byte signed values, peek null terminated strings
* Fine grained control over which, if any, warnings will be generated by Euphoria.
