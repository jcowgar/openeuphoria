== Installation
:<<LEVELTOC level=2 depth=4>>

To install Euphoria on your machine, first read the file ##install.txt##.

Installation simply involves copying the //euphoria// files to your hard disk
under a directory named ##euphoria##, and then appending the search path of your
operating system to this directory.

When installed, the ##euphoria## directory will look something like this:

* ##\euphoria##
** readme.doc
** readme.htm
** License.txt
** ##\bin## - Interpreters ##eui.exe## and ##euiw.exe##. Translator
    ##euc.exe##. Or on //Linux/FreeBSD//,
    Interpreter ##eui## and Translator ##euc##. There are also utility
    programs such as ##ed.bat##, ##guru.bat##, etc.
** ##\include## - standard include files
*** ##\include\std## - the standard Euphoria library include files, e.g.
     ##file.e##, ##sequence.e##
** ##\source## - the complete source code (interpreter, translator, binder)
** ##\docs## - plain text, man pages, html documentation files
** ##\tutorial## - small tutorial programs to help you learn Euphoria
** ##\demo## - generic demo programs that run on all platforms
*** ##\win32## - //WIN32//-specific demo programs (optional)
*** ##\unix## - //Linux/FreeBSD/OS X//-specific demo programs (optional)
*** ##\langwar## - language war game for //Linux/FreeBSD/OS X//
*** ##\bench## - benchmark programs

The //Linux// subdirectory is not included in the //Windows// distribution,
and the ##win32## subdirectories are not included in the
 //Linux/FreeBSD// distribution. In this manual, directory names are shown
 using backslash (**\**). //Linux/FreeBSD// users should substitute forward
 slash (**/**).

=== Windows

The installer copies the required files, and modifies the ##autoexec.bat## for
 you. The ##euphoria\bin## is then on your search path, and the environment
  variable **EUDIR** is set to the euphoria directory.

=== Linux and FreeBSD

Euphoria may be installed using either the gzipped tarball, or from a
distribution specific package, if available.

The gzipped tarball is laid out similarly to the windows directory structure.
You'll need to manually edit ##/etc/profile## so the ##PATH## contains
##euphoria\bin##, and either create a ##eu.cfg## file or set up ##EUDIR##
and ##EUINC##.

The packaged version installs Euphoria in a more //Unix//-like way, putting the
executables into ##/usr/bin##, ##/usr/share/euphoria## and
##/usr/share/doc/euphoria##.  Man pages for ##eui##, ##euc##, ##eub##,
##shroud## and ##bind## are also installed.  It will also create
##/etc/euphoria/eu.cfg##, which will point to the standard euphoria include
directory in ##/usr/share/euphoria/include##.

=== Set Up the Euphoria Configuration File (eu.cfg)

Euphoria supports reading command line switches from configuration files. The 
default name for the configuration file is ##eu.cfg##. However you can specify
different ones by using the ##-C## switch.

==== Configuration file format

The configuration file is a text file. Each line in the file is either a command line switch,
a section header, an include path or a comment.
* Comments are lines that begin with a double dash {{{"--"}}}. Everything on the
line is ignored.
* A section header is a //name// enclosed in square brackets. eg. 
##[interpret]##.
** There are a number of predefined sections.
** The lines in a section are only added to the command line switches if they
 apply to the mode that Euphoria is running in.
*** [win32] Applies to Windows platform only.
*** [unix] Applies to any Unix platform only.
*** [interpret] Applies to the interpreter running in any platform.
*** [translate] Applies to the translator running in any platform.
*** [bind] Applies to the binder running in any platform.
*** [interpret:win32] Applies to the interpreter when running under //Windows// 
only.
*** [interpret:unix] Applies to the interpreter when running under //Unix// 
only.
*** [translate:win32] Applies to the translator when running under //Windows// 
only.
*** [translate:unix] Applies to the translator when running under //Unix// only.
*** [bind:win32] Applies to the binder when running under //Windows// only.
*** [bind:unix] Applies to the binder when running under //Unix// only.
*** [all] Applies to all running modes.
** All configuration lines before the first section header are assumed to be the
##[all]## section.
** You can have any number of section headers, but only the predefined ones are
used. All lines in other sections are treated as comments.
* A command line switch is a line that begins with a single dash. The entire 
line is added to the actual command line as if it was originally there.
* An include path is any other line that is not one of the above. The string 
##-I## is prepended to the line and then it is added to the command line.

When Euphoria starts up, it looks for configuration files in the following 
order ...
* for //UNIX// systems
## /etc/euphoria/eu.cfg
## ${EUDIR}/eu.cfg
## ${HOME}/.eu.cfg
## From where ever the executable is run from "<exepath>/eu.cfg"
## Current working directory - "./eu.cfg"
## Command line -C switches
* for WINDOWS systems
## ~%ALLUSERSPROFILE~%\euphoria\eu.cfg
## ~%APPDATA~%\euphoria\eu.cfg
## ~%EUDIR~%\eu.cfg
## ~%HOMEDRIVE~%\~%HOMEPATH~%\eu.cfg
## From where ever the executable is run from "<exepath>/eu.cfg"
## Current working directory - "./eu.cfg"
## Command line -C switches

* Euphoria processes every configuration file found, and in the order described 
above. This means that setting specified in earlier configuration files may be 
overridden by subsequent configuration files. For example, a configuration file 
in the current directory will override the same settings in a configuration file
in the executable's directory.
* If a configuration file contains a "-C" switch, the new configuration file
specified on that switch is processed before subsequent lines in the old file.
* A configuration file is only ever processed once. Additional references to the
same file are ignored.


== Example Programs
:<<LEVELTOC level=2 depth=4>>
=== Hello, World ===
The //mandatory// 'hello world' program is a one-liner in Euphoria.
<eucode>
puts(1, "Hello, World\n")
</eucode>
This simply calls the built-in routine ##puts## ('put string'), passing it two
parameters:- ##1##, which is the file number to output to (STDOUT - the console,
in this case) and a string of text.

=== Sorting ===
The following is an example of a more useful Euphoria program.

<eucode>
include std/console.e
sequence original_list

function merge_sort(sequence x)
-- put x into ascending order using a recursive merge sort
    integer n, mid
    sequence merged, a, b

    n = length(x)
    if n = 0 or n = 1 then
        return x  -- trivial case
    end if

    mid = floor(n/2)
    a = merge_sort(x[1..mid])       -- sort first half of x
    b = merge_sort(x[mid+1..n])     -- sort second half of x

    -- merge the two sorted halves into one
    merged = {}
    while length(a) > 0 and length(b) > 0 do
        if compare(a[1], b[1]) < 0 then
            merged = append(merged, a[1])
            a = a[2..length(a)]
        else
            merged = append(merged, b[1])
            b = b[2..length(b)]
        end if
    end while
    return merged & a & b  -- merged data plus leftovers
end function

procedure print_sorted_list()
-- generate sorted_list from original_list
    sequence sorted_list
    
    original_list = {19, 10, 23, 41, 84, 55, 98, 67, 76, 32}
    sorted_list = merge_sort(original_list)
    for i = 1 to length(sorted_list) do
    	display("Number [] was at position [:2], now at [:2]", 
    	        {sorted_list[i], find(sorted_list[i], original_list), i}
    	    )
    end for
end procedure

print_sorted_list()     -- this command starts the program
</eucode>

The above example contains a number of statements that are processed in order.
; ##include std/console.e## 
: This  tells the Euphoria that this application needs
access to the public symbols declared in the file
'std/console.e'. This is referred to as a //library//
file. In our case here, the application will be using
the ##display()## routine from console.e.

; ##sequence original_list## 
: This declares a variable that is not public but is 
accessible from anywhere in this file. The datatype
for the variable is a ##sequence##, which is a 
variable-length array, and whose symbol name is
##original_list##.

; ##function merge_sort(sequence x) ... end function## 
: This declares and defines
a function routine. Functions return values when called.
This function must be passed a single parameter when
called - a sequence.

; ##procedure print_sorted_list() ... end procedure## 
: This declares and defines
a procedure routine. Procedures never return values when called.
This procedure must not be passed any parameters when
called.

; ##print_sorted_list()## 
: This calls the routine called ##print_sorted_list##.

The output from the program will be:
{{{
Number 10 was at position  2, now at  1
Number 19 was at position  1, now at  2
Number 23 was at position  3, now at  3
Number 32 was at position 10, now at  4
Number 41 was at position  4, now at  5
Number 55 was at position  6, now at  6
Number 67 was at position  8, now at  7
Number 76 was at position  9, now at  8
Number 84 was at position  5, now at  9
Number 98 was at position  7, now at 10
}}}

Note that ##merge_sort()## will just as easily sort any list of data items ...
<eucode>
{1.5, -9, 1e6, 100}
{"oranges", "apples", "bananas"}
</eucode>

This example is stored as ##euphoria\tutorial\example.ex##. This is not the
fastest way to sort in Euphoria. Go to the ##euphoria\demo## directory and type

<eucode>
eui allsorts
</eucode>

to compare timings on several different sorting algorithms for increasing
numbers of objects.

For a quick tutorial example of Euphoria programming, see
##euphoria\demo\bench\filesort.ex##.


=== What to Do?

Now that you have installed Euphoria, here are some things you can try:

==== Run the Demo Programs

Run each of the demo programs in the ##demo## directory. You just type
##eui <program name>##.
An example of running the demos in a console
{{{
eui buzz
}}}

You can also double-click on a ##.ex## or ##.exw## file from //Windows// as file
associations have been setup during the installation process.

==== Edit Sample Files

Use the Euphoria editor, ##ed##, to edit a Euphoria file. Notice the use of colors. You can
adjust these colors along with the cursor size and many other "user-modifiable" parameters by
editing constant declarations in ##ed.ex##. Use //Esc q// to quit the editor or //Esc h// for
help. There are several, even better, Euphoria-oriented editors in
[[http://www.rapideuphoria.com/edi.htm|The Archive]]. If you use a more sophisticated text
editor, many have a highlighter file for Euphoria. You will find it either on the Archive or
on the community page for that editor. Check 
[[wiki:Editors|the wiki for more information about Euphoria editors]].

==== Benchmark

Create some new benchmark tests. See ##demo\bench##. Do you get the same speed ratios as we
did in comparison with other popular languages? Report your findings on 
[[http://openeuphoria.org/forum/index.wc|the forum]].

==== Read the Manual

Read the manual in ##html\index.html## by double-clicking it. 
If you have a specific question, type at the console:

{{{
guru word
}}}

The ##guru## program will search all the ##.doc## files, example programs, and other files,
and will present you with a //sorted// list of the most relevant chunks of text that might
answer your enquiry.

==== Visit the EuForum
[[http://openeuphoria.org/forum/index.wc|Euphoria Discussion Forum]]


==== Trace a Demo

Try running a Euphoria program with ##tracing## turned on. Add:

<eucode>
with trace
trace(1)
</eucode>

at the beginning of any Euphoria source file.

==== Run the Tutorial Programs

Run some of the tutorial programs in ##euphoria\tutorial##.

==== Modify the Tutorial Programs

Try modifying some of the demo programs.

First some //simple// modifications (takes less than a minute):

===== Simple

What if there were 100 C~+~+ ships in **Language Wars**? What if ##sb.ex## had to move 1000
balls instead of 125? Change some parameters in ##polygon.ex##. Can you get prettier
pictures to appear? Add some funny phrases to ##buzz.ex##.

===== Harder

Then, some slightly harder ones (takes a few minutes):

Define a new function of x and y in ##plot3d.ex##.

===== Challenging

Then a challenging one (takes an hour or more):

Set up your own customized database by defining the
fields in ##mydata.ex##.

===== Major

Then a major project (several days or weeks):

Write a //smarter// 3D TicTacToe algorithm.

==== Write Your Own

Try writing your own program in Euphoria. A program can be as simple as:

<eucode>
? 2+2
</eucode>

**Remember that after any error you can simply type:** ##ed## to jump into the editor at the
offending file and line.

Once you get used to it, you'll be developing programs //much// faster in Euphoria than you
could in Perl, Java, C/C~+~+ or any other language that we are aware of.


== Creating Euphoria programs
:<<LEVELTOC level=2 depth=4>>

Euphoria programs can be written with //any// plain text editor. As a
convenience Euphoria comes with ##ed##, an editor written in Euphoria, that
is handy for editing and executing Euphoria programs. Take a look at
##\euphoria\demo## and ##euphoria\tutorial## to see many example programs.

=== Running a Program

To run a Euphoria program you type the name of the interpreter followed by the
filename of the program you want to run. Such as:

<eucode>
eui example.ex
</eucode>

What you just typed is known as the //command-line//.

Depending on the platform you are using the interpreter could be called:

|| Executable || Purpose                                        ||
| ##eui##     | General interpreter on Windows and *nix variants |
| ##euiw##    | Console-less Windows interpreter                 |

\\The command-line may contain extra information. Following your program 
filename
you may add extra words (known as //arguments//) that can used in your
program to customize its behavior. These arguments are read within your
program by the built-in function [[:command_line]]().

Optionally, you may also use [[:command line switches]] that are typed between
the interpreter name and the program name. Command line switches
customize  how the interpreter itself behaves.

Unlike many other compilers and interpreters, there is no obligation for any
special command-line options for ##eui## or ##euiw##. Only the
name of you Euphoria file is expected, and if you don't supply it, Euphoria
will display all the command line options available.

Euphoria doesn't care about your choice of file extensions. By
convention, however, console-based applications have an extension of ##.ex##,
GUI-based applications have an extension of ##.exw## and include files have an
extension of ##.e##. Note that a GUI application is not necessarily a
Microsoft Windows (tm) program. A GUI application can exist on Linux,
OS X, FreeBSD, etc...

You can redirect standard input and standard output when you run a Euphoria
 program, for example:
<eucode>
eui filesort.ex < raw.txt > sorted.txt
</eucode>
or simply,
<eucode>
eui filesort < raw.txt > sorted.txt
</eucode>

For frequently-used programs under //Windows// you might want to make a
small ##.bat## (batch) file, perhaps called ##myprog.bat##, containing two
statements like:
<eucode>
@echo off
eui myprog.ex %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
</eucode>
The first statement turns off echoing of commands to the screen. The second
runs ##eui myprog.ex## with up to 9 command-line arguments. See
[[:command_line]]() for an example of how to read these arguments. Having
a .bat file will save you the minor inconvenience of typing ##eui##
all the time; i.e., you can just type:
<eucode>
myprog
</eucode>
instead of:
<eucode>
eui myprog
</eucode>

Under modern //Unix// variants, you can use ##~#!/usr/bin/env eui## as the
first line of your script file. On older //Unix// variants, you may need to
use the full path to ##eui##, ##~#!/usr/local/bin/eui##.

If your program is called ##foo.ex##:
<eucode>
#!/usr/bin/env eui

procedure foo()
   ? 2+2
end procedure

foo()
</eucode>

Then if you make your file executable:

<eucode>
chmod +x foo.ex
</eucode>

You can just type:

<eucode>
foo.ex
</eucode>

to run your program. You could even shorten the name to simply "foo". Euphoria
ignores the first line when it starts with **#!**.  Be careful though that
your first line ends with the unix-style ##\n##, and not the
//Windows//-style ##\r\n##, or the unix shell might get confused. If your
file is shrouded, you must give the path to ##eub##, not ##eui##.

You can also run ##bind## to combine your Euphoria program
with ##eui## interpreter, to make a stand-alone executable file. With a
stand-alone executable, you //can// redirect standard input and output. Binding
is discussed further in [[:Distributing a Program]].

Using the [[:Euphoria To C Translator]], you can also make a stand-alone
executable file, and it will normally run much faster than a bound program.

=== Running under Windows

You can run Euphoria programs directly from the //Windows// environment, or
from a console shell that you have opened from //Windows//. By "associating"
##.ex## files with ##eui.exe## and ##.exw##
files with ##euiw.exe##. You will then be able to double click a Euphoria source
file to run it. The installer will perform this operation for you, if you wish.

== Editing a Program

You can use any text editor to edit a Euphoria program. However, Euphoria comes
with its own special editor that is written entirely in Euphoria. Type: ##ed##
followed by the complete name of the file you wish to edit. You can use this
editor to edit any kind of text file. When you edit a Euphoria file, some extra
features such as color syntax highlighting and auto-completion of certain
statements, are available to make your job easier.

Whenever you run a Euphoria program and get an error message, during
compilation or execution, you can simply type ##ed## with no file name and you
will be automatically positioned in the file containing the error, at the
correct line and column, and with the error message displayed at the top of the
screen.

Under //Windows// you can associate ##ed.bat## with various kinds of text files
that you want to edit. Color syntax highlighting is provided for ##.ex##,
##.exw##, ##.exd##, ##.e## and ##.pro## ([[:profile_file "profile files"]]).

Most keys that you type are inserted into the file at the cursor position. Hit
the ##Esc## key once to get a menu bar of special commands. The arrow keys, and
the ##Insert/Delete/Home/End/PageUp/PageDown## keys are also active. Under
//Linux/FreeBSD// some keys may not be available, and alternate keys are
provided. See [[:Ed - Euphoria Editor]] for a complete description of
the editing commands.

If you need to understand or modify any detail of the editor's operation, you
can edit the file ##ed.ex## in ##euphoria\bin## (be sure to make a backup copy
so you don't lose your ability to edit).  If the name ##ed## conflicts with
some other command on your system, simply rename the file
##euphoria\bin\ed.bat## to something else. Because this editor is written in
Euphoria, it is remarkably concise and easy to understand. The same
functionality implemented in a language like C, would take far more lines of
code.

##ed## is a simple text-mode editor that runs on all platforms and is
distributed with Euphoria. There is a list of other editors at the
[[wiki:Editors|OpenEuphoria web site]], many of which include extra
features such as syntax highlighting.

== Distributing a Program

Euphoria provides you with 4 distinct ways of distributing a program.

* "source-code", with the Euphoria "interpreter"
* "shroud" into ##.il## code, with Euphoria "backend"
* "bind" into a Euphoria executable
* "translate" into a C-compiled executable


In the first method you simply ship your users the interpreter along with your
Euphoria source files including any Euphoria includes that may be necessary
from the ##euphoria/include## directory. If the Euphoria source files and the
interpreter are placed together in one directory then your user can run your
program by typing ##eui## followed by the path of your main executable sort
file. You might also provide a small ##.bat## file so people won't actually
have to type the interpreter name. This method assumes that you are willing to
share your Euphoria source code with your users.

The Binder gives you two more methods of distribution. You can ##shroud## your
program, or you can ##bind## your program. **Shrouding** combines all of the
Euphoria source code that your program needs to create a single ##.il## file.
**Binding** combines your shrouded program with the Euphoria backend
(##eub## or ##eubw## on Windows) to create a single, stand-alone executable file.
For example, if your program is called "##myprog.ex##" you can create 
"##myprog.exe##"
which will run identically. For more information about shrouding and binding,
see [[:Binding and Shrouding]].

Finally, with the [[:Euphoria To C Translator]], you can translate your
Euphoria program into C and then compile it with a C compiler to get an
executable program.


== Command line switches
:<<LEVELTOC level=2 depth=4>>

You can launch Euphoria with some extra command line switches, in order to add
or change configuration elements. When running a GUI, there is always some way
to open a prompt and enter any text with options, arguments and whatever the
program being launched may need for proper, expected operation. Under 
//Windows//,
this is achieved by clicking the ##Start## button and selecting ##Run...##, or hitting 
##Windows-R##.

Command line switches may be changed or added, one at a time.

@[batch_command_line]
; ##-BATCH## (all)
: Executes the program but if any error occurs, the "Press Enter" prompt is
  not presented. The exit code will be set to 1 on error, 0 on success. This
  option can also be set via the [[:with_batch "with batch"]] directive.

; ##-COPYRIGHT## (all)
: Displays the copyright banner for euphoria.

@[eu.cfg]
; ##-C config_file## (all)
: Specifies either a file name or the path for where the default file called
  eu.cfg exists. The configuration file which holds a set of additional
  command line switches. See Also [[:Configuration file format]]

; ##-CON## (translator)
: Windows only.  Specifies that the translated program should be a console
  application.  The default is to build a windowed application.

; ##-D word## (all)
: Defines a word as being set. Words are processed by the [[:ifdef statement]].
  Words can also be defined via the [[:with / without define]] directive.

; ##-DEBUG## (translator)
: The translated euphoria code will include 

; ##-DLL, -SO## (translator)
: Compiles and links the translated euphoria code into a DLL, SO or DYLIB 
(depending on the platform).

; ##-EUDIR dir## (all)
: This overrides the environment variable EUDIR.

; ##-H, --HELP, -?## (all)
: Displays the list of available command line options.

; ##-I include_path## (all)
: Specifies an extra include path.

; ##-LIB file## (translator)
: Specifies the run-time library to use when translating euphoria programs.

; ##-PLAT word## (translator)
: Specify the target platform for translation.  This allows euphoria code to
  be translated for any supported platform from any other supported platform.
  Supported platforms: FREEBSD, LINUX, NETBSD, OPENBSD, OSX, SUNOS, WIN

; ##-STRICT## (all)
: This turns on all warnings, overriding any with/without warning statement
  found in the source. This option can also be set via the
  [[:with/without warning]] directive.

; ##-TEST## (all)
: Parses the code only and issues any warnings or errors to ##STDOUT##. On
  error the exit code will be 1, otherwise 0. If an error was found, the
  normal "Press Enter" prompt will not be presented when using the ##-TEST##
  parameter which enables many editor/IDE programs to test the syntax of your
  Euphoria source in real time.

; ##-VERSION## (all)
: Displays the version of euphoria that is running.

; ##-W warning_name## (all)
: Resets, or adds to, the current list of warnings that may be emitted. The list
of known names is to be found in the subsection [[:with/without warning]]. A 
name should appear without quotes.
  If the ##warning_name## begins with a plus symbol '##+##', this warning is 
  added to the current
  set of warnings checked for, otherwise the first usage resets the list 
  to the warning being introduced, and each subsequent ##-W## warning_name adds 
  to the list.

; ##-WF file_name## (all)
: Sets the file where the warnings should go instead of the standard error. 
Warnings are written to that file regardless of whether or not there are errors 
in the source. If there are no warnings, the ##-wf## file is not created. If the
##-wf## file cannot be created, a suitable message
 is displayed on STDERR and written to ##ex.err##.
 
; ##-X##;
: Resets, or adds to, the list of warnings that will not be issued. This is 
opposite of the ##-W## switch.

The case of the switches is ignored, so ##-I## and ##-i## are equivalent.

=== Further notes

* Included files are searched for in all included paths, in the following order:
## The current path
## Paths specified in a ##-I## command line switch, which can also come from any
   configuration files found.
## Paths listed in the ##EUINC## environment variable, in the order in which 
they appear
## Paths listed in the ##EUDIR## environment variable, in the order in which 
they appear
## The interpreter's path
