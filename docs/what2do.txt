== What to Do?

Now that you have installed Euphoria, here are some things you can try:

=== Run the Demo Programs

Run each of the demo programs in the ##demo## directory. You just type ##ex, exwc##  or 
##exu## followed by the name of the ##.ex, .exw## or ##.exu## file, e.g.

{{{
ex buzz
}}}

will run the file ##buzz.ex##. Depending on your graphics card you may have to edit a line in 
some of the ##.ex## files to select a different graphics mode. Some demos try to use 
**SVGA** modes, which might not work with your video card. You need DOS mouse support to 
run ##mouse.ex## and ##ttt.ex##.

You can also double-click on a ##.ex## (##.exw##) file from //Windows//, but you will have to 
"associate" ##.ex## files with ##ex.exe## and ##.exw## files with ##exw.exe##. A few of the 
demos are meant to be run from the command line, but most will look ok from Windows.

=== Edit Sample Files

Use the Euphoria editor, ##ed##, to edit a Euphoria file. Notice the use of colors. You can 
adjust these colors along with the cursor size and many other "user-modifiable" parameters by 
editing constant declarations in ##ed.ex##. Use //Esc q// to quit the editor or //Esc h// for 
help. There are several, even better, Euphoria-oriented editors in 
[[http://www.rapideuphoria.com/edi.htm|The Archive]].

=== Benchmark

Create some new benchmark tests. See ##demo\bench##. Do you get the same speed ratios as we 
did in comparison with other popular languages?

=== Read the Manual

Read the manual in ##html\index.html## by double-clicking it. The simple expressive power of 
Euphoria makes this manual much shorter than manuals for other languages. If you have a 
specific question, type at the console: 

{{{
guru word
}}}

The ##guru## program will search all the ##.doc## files, example programs and other files 
and will present you with a //sorted// list of the most relevant chunks of text that might 
answer your enquiry.

=== Trace a Demo

Try running a Euphoria program with ##tracing## turned on. Add:

<eucode>
with trace
trace(1)
</eucode>

at the beginning of any Euphoria source file.
	
=== Run the Tutorial Programs

Run some of the tutorial programs in ##euphoria\tutorial##.

=== Modify the Tutorial Programs

Try modifying some of the demo programs.

First some //simple// modifications (takes less than a minute):
	
==== Simple

What if there were 100 C~+~+ ships in **Language Wars**? What if ##sb.ex## had to move 1000 
balls instead of 125? Change some parameters in ##polygon.ex##. Can you get prettier 
pictures to appear? Add some funny phrases to ##buzz.ex##.

==== Harder

Then, some slightly harder ones (takes a few minutes):
   
Define a new function of x and y in ##plot3d.ex##.

==== Challenging

Then a challenging one (takes an hour or more):

Set up your own customized database by defining the 
fields in ##mydata.ex##.
   
==== Major

Then a major project (several days or weeks): 

Write a //smarter// 3D ~TicTacToe algorithm.

=== Write Your Own

Try writing your own program in Euphoria. A program can be as simple as:

<eucode>
? 2+2
</eucode>

**Remember that after any error you can simply type:** ##ed## to jump into the editor at the 
offending file and line. 

Once you get used to it, you'll be developing programs //much// faster in Euphoria than you 
could in Perl, Java, C/C~+~+ or any other language that we are aware of.
