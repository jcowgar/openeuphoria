= Euphoria Programming Language v4.0

Welcome to Euphoria! //**E**nd **U**ser **P**rogramming with **H**ierarchical 
**O**bjects for **R**obust **I**nterpreted **A**pplications//.

Euphoria has come a long way since v1.0 was released in July 1993 by **R**apid
**D**eployment **S**oftware (//RDS//).
There are now enthusiastic users around the world.  


=== Yet Another Programming Language?

Euphoria is a very high-level programming language. It is unique amongst a
crowd of conventional languages.

=== First, Euphoria delivers the "expected" features of a modern language:

* open source
* free for personal and commercial use
* produces royalty-free, stand-alone, programs
* multi-platform{{{--}}}Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, OSX, and even Dos
* provides a choice of multi-platform gui toolkits: IUP, GTK, wxWindows
* features a Windows IDE and gui library written in Euphoria
* syntax-colored editors, profiling, and tracing of code
* dynamic memory allocation and efficient garbage collection
* interfacing to existing C libraries and databases
* well-documented, lots of example source-code, and an enthusiastic forum
* edit and run convenience

=== Euphoria is unique

What makes Euphoria unique is a design that uses an atom/sequence paradigm
for data-types. An **atom** is single numeric value (either a number or
character), while a **sequence** is a collection of numeric values (atoms,
strings, nested sequences, ... ). 

What follows from this design are some advantages over conventional languages:

* the language syntax is smaller{{{--}}}and thus easier to learn
* the language syntax is consistent{{{--}}}and thus easier to program
* routines are more generic{{{--}}}a routine used for strings may also be 
applied to any data structure
* a higher level view of programming{{{--}}}because sequences encompass
conventional lists, arrays, tables, tuples, ..., and all other
data-structures.
* sequences are dynamic{{{--}}}you may create and destroy at will{{{--}}}and 
modify them to any size and complexity

=== Euphoria has qualities that go beyond the elegance of sequences

* Euphoria programs are considerably faster than conventional interpreted
languages{{{--}}}Euphoria makes a better website server
* Euphoria programs can be translated then compiled as C programs{{{--}}}fast
programs become even faster
* Euphoria lets you write multi-tasking programs{{{--}}}independent of the 
platform you are using
* Euphoria has a coherent design{{{--}}}Euphoria programmers enjoy programming 
in Euphoria

=== As a first programming language:

* Easy to learn, easy to program
* No limits as to what you can program
* Euphoria programming skills will enhance learning other languages

=== As an extension to languages you already know:

* A fast, flexible, and powerful language
* Euphoria, the language you will prefer to program in

=== But, my favorite language is ...

You will find that Euphoria programmers are also knowledgeable in other
languages. I find that the more tools you have (saws and hammers, or programming
languages) the richer you are. Picking the correct tool is part of the art of
programming. It will remain true that some people can program better in their
favorite language rather than an arguably superior language. 

Give Euphoria a try, and discover why it has enthusiastic supporters.

=== Products

This **Euphoria Interpreter, Binder, and Translator** package is free for anyone
to use.

Using the //Euphoria// **Binder** is used to create stand-alone programs.

The //Euphoria// **Translator** converts Euphoria-source into C-source. This 
allows Euphoria programs to be compiled by a standard C compiler to make even 
faster stand-alone programs.

You can freely distribute the Euphoria interpreter, and any other files
contained in this package, in whole or in part, so anyone can run a Euphoria
program that you have developed. You are completely free to distribute any
Euphoria programs that you write.

=== Requirements

To run the //WIN32// version of Euphoria, you need Windows 95 or any later
version of Windows.  It runs fine on XP and Vista.

The //DOS32// version will run on any version of Windows, and will also run on
plain DOS on any 386 or higher processor. Contrary to popular opinion, DOS is
not dead. You can run DOS Euphoria programs on Windows XP in a command prompt
window.

To run the //Linux// version of Euphoria you need any reasonably up-to-date
Linux distribution, that has libc6 or later. For example, Red Hat 5.2 or later
will work fine.

To run the //FreeBSD// version of Euphoria you need any reasonably up-to-date
FreeBSD distribution. 

To run the //Mac OS X// version of Euphoria, you need any reasonably up-to-date
Intel based Mac.

=== Shareware Vendors

We encourage you to distribute this Euphoria Interpreter package. You can
charge whatever you like for it. People can use Euphoria for as long as they
like without obligation.
