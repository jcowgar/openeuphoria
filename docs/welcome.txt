== Introduction

Welcome to Euphoria! //**E**nd **U**ser **P**rogramming with **H**ierarchical **O**bjects for
**R**obust **I**nterpreted **A**pplications//.

Euphoria has come a long way since v1.0 was released in July 1993 by **R**apid
**D**eployment **S**oftware (//RDS//).
There are now thousands of users around the world.  There's an automated a
[[http://www.OpenEuphoria.org/EUforum|discussion forum]], managed and moderated
by a Euphoria program, and supporting over 500 subscribers.  The
[[http://www.rapideuphoria.com|Euphoria Web site]] contains over 1800
contributed compressed files packed with Euphoria source programs and library
routines. Dozens of people have set up their own [[http://www.rapideuphoria.com/othersit.htm|independent Web pages with
Euphoria-related content]].  Euphoria has been used in a variety of commercial
programs.  The //Windows// version has been used to create numerous GUI,
utility and Internet-related programs. The //DOS// version has been used to
create many exciting high-speed action games, complete with Sound Blaster sound
effects.  The //Linux// and //FreeBSD// versions have been used to write GUI 
programs, Web-based (CGI, FastCGI and SCGI) programs, and lots of useful tools and utilities.

== Yet Another Programming Language?

Euphoria is a very-high-level programming language with several features that
set it apart from the crowd:

* Euphoria programs run on:
** Windows
** DOS
** Linux
** FreeBSD
** Mac OS X
* Euphoria is free and open source
* The language is flexible, powerful, and easy to learn.
* There is no waiting for compiles and links - just edit and run. 
* You can create and distribute a royalty-free, stand-alone executable files.
* Dynamic storage allocation is fundamental to Euphoria. Arrays grow or 
  shrink in size without the programmer having to worry about allocating and 
  freeing chunks of memory. Elements of an array (Euphoria sequence) can be 
  a dynamic mixture of different types and sizes of data.
* Euphoria provides **extensive run-time error checking** for: out-of-bounds 
  subscripts, uninitialized variables, bad parameter values for library routines, 
  illegal value assigned to a variable, and many more. If something goes wrong you'll 
  get a full error message, with a call traceback and a listing of variable values. 
  With other languages you'll typically get protection faults  with useless dumps of 
  machine registers and addresses.
* The Euphoria interpreter is more than **30 times faster** than either Perl or Python, 
  and it's considerably faster than all other interpreted languages, according to the 
  "Great Computer Language Shootout" benchmark (see ##demo\bench\bench.doc##).
* If that isn't enough, there's a **Euphoria To C Translator** that can translate any 
  Euphoria program to C, and boost your speed even more. Why waste time debugging 
  hand-coded ``C/C++``? You can easily develop a Euphoria program, and then generate the C code.
* Euphoria programs are not constrained by any 640K memory restrictions for which MS-DOS is 
  infamous. All versions of Euphoria let you use all the memory on your system, and if that 
  isn't enough, a swap file on disk will provide additional virtual memory.
* An integrated, easy-to-use, full-screen source-level debugger/tracer is included.
* Both an execution-count profiler, and a time profiler are available.
* There is a large and rapidly growing collection of excellent 3rd party programs and 
  libraries, most with full source code.
* //RDS// has developed a flexible and simple database system (**EDS**) that is portable 
  across all Euphoria platforms.
* The //WIN32// implementation of Euphoria can access any WIN32 API routine, as well as 
  C or Euphoria routines in .DLL files. A team of people has developed a Windows GUI 
  library (**Win32Lib**), complete with a powerful Interactive Development Environment.
  You can design a user interface graphically, specify the Euphoria statements to be 
  executed when someone clicks, and the IDE will create a complete Euphoria program 
  for you. There are Windows Euphoria libraries for Internet access, 3-D games, and 
  many other application areas. 
* The //DOS32// implementation of Euphoria on MS-DOS contains a built-in graphics 
  library. If necessary, you can access DOS software interrupts. You can call 
  machine-code routines. You can even set up your own hardware interrupt handlers. 
  Many high-speed action games, complete with Sound Blaster sound effects, have 
  been developed 100% in Euphoria, without the need for any machine code. 
* The //Linux//, //FreeBSD// and //OS X// implementations of Euphoria
  let you access C routines and variables in shared libraries, for tasks ranging 
  from graphics, to GUI programming, to Internet programming. The good news is, you'll
  be  programming in Euphoria, not C.

== Platforms and Products

Euphoria runs on four different platforms:

* Windows
* DOS
* Linux
* FreeBSD
* Mac OS X

This **Euphoria Interpreter, Translator and Binder** package is free for anyone to use.

Using the Euphoria **Binder** you can **shroud** (encrypt) and **bind** any
Euphoria program with a copy of the interpreter back-end, to create a single,
stand-alone, tamper-resistant executable file for easy distribution.

The **Euphoria To C Translator** converts any Euphoria program into a
stand-alone executable file, but it has the added advantage of boosting the
program's speed as well. To use it, you must have one of 7 free C compilers
installed on your machine, but no knowledge of C is required. 

The documentation contained in this package comes in both plain text and HTML
form. The plain text (##.doc##) files can be viewed with any text editor, such
as Windows NotePad or WordPad. The HTML (##.htm##) files can be viewed with
your Web browser. A tool that we developed in Euphoria allows us to
automatically generate both plain text and HTML files, from a common source.
Thus the content of each file in the ##doc## subdirectory should be identical
to the content of the corresponding file in the ##html## subdirectory, aside
from the lack of links, fonts, colors, etc. See ##doc\overview.doc## (or
<a href="html/overview.htm">**html\overview.htm**</a>) for a summary of the
documentation files.

You can freely distribute the Euphoria interpreter, and any other files
contained in this package, in whole or in part, so anyone can run a Euphoria
program that you have developed. You are completely free to distribute any
Euphoria programs that you write.

To run the //WIN32// version of Euphoria, you need Windows 95 or any later
version of Windows.  It runs fine on XP and Vista.

The //DOS32// version will run on any version of Windows, and will also run on
plain DOS on any 386 or higher processor. Contrary to popular opinion, DOS is
not dead. You can run DOS Euphoria programs on Windows XP in a command prompt
window.

To run the //Linux// version of Euphoria you need any reasonably up-to-date
Linux distribution, that has libc6 or later. For example, Red Hat 5.2 or later
will work fine.

To run the //FreeBSD// version of Euphoria you need any reasonably up-to-date
FreeBSD distribution. 

To run the //Mac OS X// version of Euphoria, you need any reasonably up-to-date
Intel based Mac.
