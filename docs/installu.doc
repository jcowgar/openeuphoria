 
== How to Install Euphoria on Linux or FreeBSD

 
Now that you've run tar to create the ##euphoria## directory,
 you need to: 
    
    1. add ##euphoria/bin## to your ##PATH##
    
    2. create an environment variable: ##EUDIR##
    
 To view the hidden files in your home directory, type: 
       
   {{{ls -a}}}
 
 One or more of these files is executed when you log in.
 For instance, if you have a hidden profile file such as 
 ".bash_profile", you can edit the line: 
 
   {{{PATH=...}}}  
 
 and add ##euphoria/bin## to it.
 
 For example, a user called ##rob## might do the following:

   {{{PATH=/home/rob/euphoria/bin:$PATH}}}

 You must also add a line for the variable ##EUDIR## such as:

   {{{EUDIR=/home/rob/euphoria}}}

 And remember to export these variables, by adding this line:
 
   {{{export PATH EUDIR}}}

 ##euphoria/bin## doesn't have to be first on your ##PATH##, but if it isn't 
 you'll have to rename the "ed" shell script in ##euphoria/bin##, and perhaps a 
 few others.

 Alternatively, system administrators can put ##EUDIR## and the ##PATH## change 
 into a global file, such as ##/etc/profile##, so many users will be able 
 to access the Euphoria interpreter.
