== Euphoria Credits

Euphoria has been continuously developed since it was started in 1993
by Robert Craig. In 2006 version 3.0 was released as open source. Various
releases were made to the 3.x series and then in 2009 version 4.0 was
released... Euphoria's biggest release ever.

It has taken quite a few people to get thus far and we would like to
recognize them here. Authors/Contributors are listed in alphabetical
