== Euphoria Credits
:<<LEVELTOC level=2 depth=4>>

Euphoria has been continuously developed since it was started in 1993
by Robert Craig. In 2006, version 3.0 was released as open source. Various
releases were made to the 3.x series and then in 2009, development on [[Euphoria4|version 4.0]] was
begun. Euphoria 4 is expected to be released in early 2011.

It has taken quite a few people to get this far and we would like to
recognize them here. Authors/Contributors are listed in alphabetical 
order by their last name.
