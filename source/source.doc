		Pure Euphoria Interpreter

This directory contains a Euphoria interpreter written in Euphoria.
It was developed by Rapid Deployment Software. There are no restrictions 
on how you may use these files. See Euphoria\License.txt. The front-end
is shared with the official, fast Interpreter and the Translator and Binder. 
The back-end is written in Euphoria itself.

To run a Euphoria program on a given platform:

   eui eu.ex prog.ex          (DOS)
   
   eui eu.ex prog.exw        (Windows)
   
   eui eu.ex prog.exu        (Linux /FreeBSD)

To bind the interpreter into a .exe for a given platform:

   bind eu.ex                (DOS)
   
   bindw eu.ex               (Windows) 
   
   bindu eu.ex               (Linux / FreeBSD)

To translate the interpreter into a fast .exe for a given platform:
   
   ec [-wat] [-djg] eu.ex    (DOS)

   euc [-wat] eu.ex          (Windows)

   euc eu.ex                 (Linux / FreeBSD)


Files that make up the interpreter:

global.e   - global constants and variables
keylist.e  - list of keywords and built-in routines
symtab.e   - symbol table access routines
scanner.e  - scanner (low-level parser), forms "words" from characters
parser.e   - parser - hand-coded recursive descent technique - no special tools
emit.e     - intermediate language code emitter
pathopen.e - opens a file on the PATH
eu.ex      - top level file
reswords.e - constants for intermediate language etc.
error.e    - compile-time error handler
main.e     - main program
opnames.e  - names of all the intermediate language operations
execute.e  - the "back-end" executor of intermediate language opcodes

In the official (fast) interpreter, execute.e is replaced by a very large 
amount of hand-coded C. Because execute.e is written in Euphoria, it
is rather trivial in most cases.
