	install.ex   - The Euphoria install program. You've already installed
	               Euphoria, so this is here just for educational purposes.
	               Feel free to use it as a base for your own install
	               programs.

   registered users only:
	bind         - bind a Linux Euphoria program with eub.exe to make
	               a stand-alone executable file
	shroud       - source code shrouder, makes a .il file
	bind.il	     - a shrouded Euphoria program used by 
	               shroud.bat and bind.bat

   There are small shell scripts for most of the .ex utilities, so you
   don't have to type "eui ...", e.g. just type "ascii" to turn run the
   ascii.ex program.

   Many of these programs expect to be run from a command line interface.
