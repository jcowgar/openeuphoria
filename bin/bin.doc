   There are small .bat files for most of the .ex utilities, so you
   don't have to type "ex ...", e.g. just type "ascii" to turn run the
   ascii.ex program. 

   Many of these programs expect to be run from a command line interface.

   For more documentation, see the comments at the top of each file.
