 Download and run the latest Euphoria setup program. It will install Euphoria
 on any Windows system from Windows 95 up.

 After installing, see doc\what2do.doc (or html\what2do.htm) for ideas on how
 to use this package. You should also read readme.doc (or readme.htm) if you
 haven't done so already.


 Possible problems ...
 ---------------------

      * If the install appeared to run ok, but example programs are not
        working, did you remember to shut down and restart your computer?

      * On Windows XP/2000, be careful that your PATH and EUDIR do not conflict
        with autoexec.nt, which can also be used to set environment variables.

      * On WinME/98/95 if the install program fails to edit your autoexec.bat
        file, you will have to do it yourself. Follow the manual procedure
        described below.

      * Euphoria can be run under DOS on older Win 3.1 systems, but we no
        longer maintain an install program for this. You'll have to install
        Euphoria on a newer system and then copy your EUPHORIA directory to the
        old system. Set up AUTOEXEC.BAT manually on the old system as described
        below.


 How to manually edit autoexec.bat (WinME/98/95/3.1)
 ----------------------------------------------------

 1.  - In the file c:\autoexec.bat add C:\EUPHORIA\BIN to the list of
       directories in your PATH command. You might use the MS-DOS Edit command,
       Windows Notepad or any other text editor to do this.

       You can also go to the Start Menu, select Run, type in sysedit and press
       Enter. autoexec.bat should appear as one of the system files that you
       can edit and save.

 2.  - In the same autoexec.bat file add a new line:

               SET EUDIR=C:\EUPHORIA
       
       The EUDIR environment variable indicates the full path to the main
       Euphoria directory.

 3.  - Reboot (restart) your machine. This will define your new PATH and EUDIR
       environment variables.


 On WinNT/2000/XP and higher, if for some reason your EUDIR and PATH variables
 are not set correctly, then set them in whatever way your system allows. For
 example on Windows XP select: Start Menu -> Control Panel -> Performance
 &Maintenance -> System -> Advanced then click the "Environment Variables"
 button. Click the top "New..." button then enter EUDIR as the Variable Name
 and c:\euphoria (or whatever is correct) for the value, then click OK. Find
 PATH in the list of your variables, select it, then click "Edit...". Add
 ;c:\euphoria\bin at the end and click OK.

 Some systems, such as Windows ME, have an autoexec.bat file, but it's a hidden
 file that might not show up in a directory listing. Nevertheless it's there,
 and you can view it and edit it if necessary by typing, for example: notepad
 c:\autoexec.bat in a DOS window.

 If you have an autoexec.bat file, but it doesn't contain a PATH command, you
 will have to create one that includes C:\EUPHORIA\BIN.

 How to Uninstall Euphoria
 =========================

     1. If you wish to recover your previous version of Euphoria, or parts
        of it, the "backup" subdirectory contains a backup copy of each 
        of your previous standard Euphoria subdirectories, plus any files
        that you may have added. However it does not contain any additional 
        subdirectories that you may have created on your own.
     
     2. If there are no files that you need, you can delete the EUPHORIA 
        directory that you installed into.
     
     3. Delete the EUDIR environment variable, and remove the EUPHORIA 
        directory from your PATH, either in C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT, or in 
        Control Panel/System/Advanced.

     4. Delete the references to EUPHORIA in your Start Menu.
