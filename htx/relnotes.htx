<ul>
<p>
<li>
     <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed: </font></b>1855414.
      <b>open()</b>'s max path length is now determined by the underlying
      operating system and not a generic default. open() also now
      returns -1 when the filename is too long instead of causing
      a fatal error.  Fixed by Jeremy Cowgar
<p>
<li>
     <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed: </font></b> 1608870.
      <b>dir()</b> now handles *.abc correctly, not showing a file
      ending with .abcd. <b>dir()</b> also now supports wildcard
      characters (* and ?) on all platforms. Fixed by Jeremy Cowgar
<p>
<li>
     <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed: </font></b> gcc stack
     offset changed to -20,-24 in GCC v4.2.3 and
     later. if/else updated. Works on GCC 3.x and 4.x.

<b><_dul>Version 3.1.1 August 2007:</_dul></b></font>
<p>

This release is a minor update to fix some bugs.

<p>
<font color="#993333"><_sul><b>Bug Fixes</b></_sul></font>
<ul>
<p>
<li>
     <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed: </font></b>
      A storage leak (memory allocated but never freed) 
      was introduced in version 3.1, on the Linux and FreeBSD platforms.
      Fixed by Matthew Lewis.
      
<p>
<li>
     <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed: </font></b>
     When Euphoria failed to open the main program file, the error
     message would sometimes show the wrong file type.
     Fixed by Matthew Lewis.
        
<p>
<li>
     <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed: </font></b>
     Bugs in the new library routines, find_from() and match_from()
     were corrected. The third argument (the starting index) 
     is now tightly-checked. Fixed by Matthew Lewis and Rob Craig.

<p>
<li>
     <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed: </font></b>
    The ed script on Linux was changed to allow blanks in the path
    of the file to be edited. Fixed by Rob Craig.
    
<p>
<li>
     <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed: </font></b>
    Double-quotes were added to ed.ex so Esc e 
    will work with paths containing blanks.
    Reported by Alex Caracatsanis. Fixed by Rob Craig.
<p>
<li>
     <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed: </font></b>
    database.e was fixed so forward slashes are allowed in the 
    db_compress() file name. Reported by Frank Dowling. 
    Fixed by Rob Craig.
    
</ul>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#003366">

<b><_dul>Version 3.1 June 2007:</_dul></b></font>
<p>

This release adds some new features, fixes some bugs,
and improves the documentation.

<p>
<font color="#993333"><_sul><b>New Features</b></_sul></font>
<ul>
<p>
<li>
      New built-in routines, <b>find_from()</b> and <b>match_from()</b> 
      have been added.
      These work like find() and match() but they let you start searching
      from any element in the sequence, not necessarily at element 1.
      This makes some algorithms simpler
      and much faster. Implemented by Matthew Lewis.
      
<p>
<li>
      When searching for an include file specified with a relative 
      (i.e. not absolute) file path, Euphoria will check first for 
      a file relative to the location of the current source file.  
      If not found, then the usual rules will apply, i.e. it will
      check relative to the main program file, then check the EUINC
      directories (if any), and finally euphoria\include.
      Suggested by C.K. Lester and, in various forms, 
      by several other people. Implemented by C.K. Lester. 
      Checked in by Matt Lewis.
      
<p>
<li>
      <b>ex int.ex</b> (in euphoria\source) will now work, since the 
      interpreter now supports machine_proc(65,...) which passes IL to 
      the fast C-coded back-end. You can also run
      int.ex with exw or exu.
      This lets you easily modify the front end and get a modified 
      Euphoria interpreter, for all platforms, that runs programs 
      at full speed (much faster than the Euphoria-coded execute.e). You might 
      also bind int.ex to get a single executable file for whatever
      platform you like.
      
<p>
<li>
      If the user does not supply a filename with an extension,
      Euphoria will attempt to open the file first with the standard
      extension for its respective platform, but if it does not find it, it
      will also look for files with the standard extensions for the other
      platforms. Implemented by Matthew Lewis.
<p>
<li>
     <b>Translator: </b>
      The limit on the number of additional .c files 
      that can be created per Euphoria file has been raised from 36 to 
      well over 1000.
</ul>


<p>
<font color="#993333"><_sul><b>New Documentation</b></_sul></font>
<ul>
<p>
<li>
      The "storage cache" compression technique that's used for bound 
      executables and .il files, was documented in comments added to 
      compress.e. 
      It reduces the size of the IL by 30% or more, while allowing
      fast decompression.
     
<p>
<li>
      A documentation file, tasks.doc, was added to euphoria\demo\langwar.
      It describes the multiple tasks used in Language War.
</ul>


<p>
<font color="#993333"><_sul><b>Bug Fixes</b></_sul></font>
<ul>
<p>
<li>
     <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed: </font></b>
     <b>Translator: </b>
      Translated code for routine_id() 
        erroneously returned -1 when a global symbol was looked up which
        matched a symbol in the same file as the call to routine_id(),
        as well as a global symbol in another earlier file. It was treated 
        incorrectly as a multiply-defined symbol that was lacking a 
        namespace qualifier. Thanks to Daniel Kluss.
<p>
<li>
     <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed: </font></b>
     <b>Translator: </b>
      In rare situations, a naming conflict could 
        occur when more than one .c file is created for a Euphoria file. 
        Thanks to DB James.
        
<p>
<li>
     <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed: </font></b>
     <b>Translator:</b> 
     get_key(), when translated/compiled 
     with Borland or LCC, required an extra keystroke after a carriage return. 
     Implemented by Jacques Deschenes.

<p>
<li>
     <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed: </font></b>
     <b>Source Code Portability:</b>
       euphoria.h: CLK_TCK is now defined as CLOCKS_PER_SEC
       if not defined previously in the source. Implemented by Matt Lewis.
  
<p>
<li>
     <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed: </font></b>
      <b>Installer:</b>
      Double-quotes were added around several filenames used in the
      INNO installer script (though this did not seem to affect many people).

</ul>

<b><_dul>Version 3.0.2 February 9, 2007:</_dul></b></font>
<p>
This release fixes some important bugs in 3.0.1, and improves the
source code documentation.

<p>
<font color="#993333"><_sul><b>Bug Fixes</b></_sul></font>
<ul>
    
<p>
<li>
     <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed: </font></b>
     <b>Translator: </b>
     Programs translated to C and compiled for Windows 
     would crash if they used the new multitasking feature.
     (This worked in 3.0.0 but was broken accidentally in 3.0.1 
     because some stack offsets changed.)

<p>
<li>
    
    <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed: </font></b>
     <b>Interpreter: </b>
    
    In fairly rare situations, the interpreter for Windows might crash.
    This was due to a bug in load_private_block() where it was freeing 
    a block of memory and then returning a pointer into that block. 
    In rare cases, a page of virtual memory might be removed from 
    the heap by the Windows O/S before the block could be read. 
    Thanks to Andy Serpa, 
    Pete Lomax, Matt Lewis, Derek Parnell, and others for helping to 
    pin-point the location of the bug.
  
<p>
<li>
    <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed: </font></b>
     <b>Source Code: </b>
    "\euphoria" was changed to to %EUDIR% in 4 .bat files in the
    source directory. Thanks to Jaime Marcos.
    
</ul>

<p>
<font color="#993333"><_sul><b>Improved Documentation</b></_sul></font>
<ul>

<p>
<li>
A new document (translator.doc) was added to euphoria\source. It describes
the internals of the Translator, with emphasis on the many optimizations
that the Translator performs.

<p>
<li>
    The user documentation was also improved in a few places.     
</ul>

<font color="#993333"><_sul><b>C Source Code Changes</b></_sul></font>
<ul>
<p>
<li>
    Matthew Lewis added a Linux/FreeBSD make file, and made source code 
    changes to better support Open Watcom and a newer version of GCC.
</ul>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#003366">
<b><_dul>Version 3.0.1 November 3, 2006:</_dul></b></font>
<p>
This release cleans up a number of bugs and documentation errors
in 3.0.0.

<p>
<font color="#993333"><_sul><b>Improved Documentation</b></_sul></font>
<ul>
<p>
<li>
     A separate new document on <a href=tasking.htm>multitasking</a>
     was added.

<p>
<li>
     Obsolete pre-open-source concepts in the 3.0.0 documentation
     were deleted or corrected.
     
</ul>

<font color="#993333"><_sul><b>Bug Fixes</b></_sul></font>
<ul>
    
<p>
<li>
     Euphoria-coded .dll / .so files were not working at all, due to a 
     multitasking-related glitch. Thanks to Andrea Cini.
     <p>
     Note: execution of multitasking built-in routines is currently not 
     supported inside a Euphoria-coded .dll / .so. 
     You'll get a compile-time error message from the 
     Translator if you use the -dll option and your library source code 
     contains multitasking operations. Other than that, use of 
     Euphoria-coded .dll / .so files by main programs that do 
     multitasking is fine.
    
<p>
<li>
     A text console bug was fixed.
     It involved output to the screen involving tabs and/or 
     wrap-around (at 80 columns). Thanks to 
     Pete Lomax, Juergen Luethje, Matt Lewis.
  
<p>
<li>
     bind.bat, bindw.bat and shroud.bat were changed to use %EUDIR%
     rather than \EUPHORIA. Thanks to Ray Smith.
    
<p>
<li>
     syncolor.e now includes keywords.e (relative to euphoria\bin)
     rather than \euphoria\bin\keywords.e. Thanks to Rick Bettis.
    
</ul>

<font color="#993333"><_sul><b>C Source Code Changes</b></_sul></font>
<ul>
<p>
<li>
     All of the #ifdef ENCURSES code was stripped out.
     We don't plan to use ncurses again, and this change
     makes parts of the source code much more readable.
<p>
<li>
     A thread5() machine language macro was added to be_execute.c 
     This helps the interpreter to compile correctly with 
     Open Watcom, avoiding a C optimizer bug.
     Thanks to Matt Lewis. 
</ul>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#003366">
<b><_dul>Version 3.0.0 October 17, 2006:</_dul></b></font>
<p>

With this release, Euphoria has become a totally <b>free</b>
and totally <b>open source</b> product! RDS will continue to develop
Euphoria with the aid of many additional clever programmers.
The free download package now includes the Interpreter (with either 
a C or a Euphoria-coded back-end), Binder/shrouder, fully-enabled 
Translator, and the full source code for all of these. 
Thousands of people can now examine the full source code for bugs, 
performance improvements, and potential new features.
<p>
Rather than having alpha, beta and official releases, we will now
simply have numbers, 3.0.0, 3.0.1 ... We expect to have releases
more frequently, though each release will likely be a smaller
change compared to the previous release.

<p>
<font color="#993333"><_sul><b>Enhanced Features</b></_sul></font>
 
<ul>
<p>
<li>
 <b>Cooperative Multitasking</b>. Rather than having just a single thread of execution,
 you can now create multiple tasks that run independently
 of one another. Each task has its own currently-executing statement,
 subroutine call-stack, and private variables for all routines on 
 its call-stack. Tasks share global and local variables but not private
 variables. At any point during its execution, a task can call task_yield()
 to transfer control to the Euphoria scheduler which will choose the next 
 task to run. When control returns to the original task, 
 execution will continue from the statement after task_yield().
 <p>
 New Run-time routines:
 
 task_create(), task_schedule(), task_yield(), task_suspend(),
 task_self(), task_list(), task_status(), task_clock_start(),
 task_clock_stop()
 
<p>
<li>
 Use of the <b>ncurses</b> library has been eliminated for Linux 
 and FreeBSD. ncurses routines sometimes caused problems on some 
 Linux/FreeBSD systems.
  The Euphoria backend now uses ANSI escape chars to 
  get 2-d positioning and colors for a plain text-mode console.
  Also, the use of libgpm (console mouse support) has been dropped on Linux. 
  (It was never supported by Euphoria on FreeBSD). 
    
<p>
<li>
  <b>Include files</b> with the same file name but a different path as an earlier
  include, will no longer be ignored. To be ignored, an include must 
  refer to the exact same file as an earlier include. 
  (a new name space can still be defined, even
   though the include file is not actually included again.)
   On Linux/FreeBSD a case-sensitive file-name comparison is now used.
   
   There is possible (but unlikely) breakage of old code:
   
   <p> 
   You might start including files 
   that you did not intend to include, if you have a previously-ignored 
   include statement for them in your code. 
   Solution: Delete the undesired include statement.
   
   <p>
   If an include is incorrect (file is not
   on the include search path), this error may have been hidden 
   under the old system, if a correct include with the same file name 
   (but different path) came earlier. Solution: Specify the correct path 
   to the include file.
   
<p>
<li>
  There is no longer a limit on the number of <b>warnings</b> that can be
  displayed. Instead, you will be given the chance to scroll through all the
  warnings, 20 at a time. As before, if a ex.err file is created,
  then all warnings will also be stored at the end of the ex.err file.
  Thanks to Judith Evans.

<p>
<li>
  <font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font>: You can set the run-time stack size for your program
  using the -stack nnnn option. The default stack size has been increased
  for most of the supported C compilers, especially when your program
  contains a call to task_create().
     
<p>
<li>
 If a run-time error occurs and ex.err can't be opened,
 a check will be made to see if it's because you have
 <b>too many open files</b>. An appropriate message will then
 be issued. Several people ran into this situation.
 
<p>
<li>
  <b>execute.e</b>: Additional run-time error checks were added to several
   run-time routines to allow the pure-Euphoria source interpreter 
   to catch more errors itself, rather than letting the C-coded 
   run-time routines used by the "real" interpreter or translator catch them.
       
<p>
<li>
  <b>pretty_print()</b>, option 3, now includes \t \r and \n as 
  valid "ASCII range" characters. This increases the
  likelihood of strings being displayed. Thanks to Juergen Luethje.
       
<p>
<li>
  The <b>ASCII 127</b> char will not be graphically displayed on Linux in 
  trace or in default pretty_print(). It displays as a backspace when 
  ANSI codes are used.
         
<p>
<li>
  <b>Binder</b> options are checked more strictly. e.g. -xxxoutxxx was dangerous
  The binder now looks for match(x,y) = 1, rather than match(x,y) != 0.
  The binder also avoids overwriting a source file when -out is used.
  Thanks to Mike Sabal, Greg Haberek
   
<p>
<li>
  We've switched to using transparent Euphoria icons.
  Thanks to Vincent Howell.
 
<p>
<li>
  Pure Euphoria interpreter (eu.ex): 
  The "not initialized" message has been improved to:
  "xyz has not been initialized"
  
<p>
<li>
  Many small improvements were made to the <b>documentation</b>. e.g. 
  the use of a single atom value by multiple printf() formats was 
  documented for the first time. Thanks to Pete Lomax.

  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed: </font></b>
  <font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font>: a Euphoria file 
  named "main.e" or "init.e"
   could possibly lead to a file naming conflict. The chance of a conflict
   is now greatly reduced, and if a conflict occurs, a meaningful error
   message will be issued.
   Thanks to Vincent Howell.

<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed: </font></b>
  <font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font>: using "interrupt"

  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed: </font></b>
  <font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font>: A call to a Euphoria-coded

   to produce no output. Thanks to Daniel Kluss.
    
<p>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed:</font></b>
   scanner.e: Source lines longer than 10000 characters caused a problem.

<b><_dul>Version 2.5 Official Release March 8, 2005:</_dul></b></font>

<p>
<font color="#993333"><_sul><b>Enhanced Features</b></_sul></font>

<ul>
<p>
<li>
The Source Code Product now includes the C code for interactive
trace/debug and profiling. This was not provided in any previous release.

<p>
<li>
<font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font>: A new <b>-fastfp</b> 
option has been added for WATCOM/DOS (registered version only). 
This option can double the speed of a floating-point intensive, 
translated/compiled, program. The resulting .exe file requires a 
Pentium class CPU, or a 386/486 with floating-point hardware.

<p>
<li>
<b>eu.ex</b>: execute.e now uses call-back machine code supplied by 
Matthew Lewis. As a result, there is no longer a limit on the number 
of call-backs a program can use. 

<p>
<li>
<font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font>: There is now a <b>-keep</b> 
option that prevents the deletion of any C files or object files created
during translation. Thanks to Matthew Lewis.

<p>
<li>
<font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font>: In order to handle huge
programs without exceeding the limits of the C compiler, the translator 
will split init_.c into several pieces. Thanks to Matthew Lewis.
    
<p>
<li>
<font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font>: Better checking is provided for
incorrect command-line options.
      
<p>
<li>
<font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font>:  The translator avoids 
creating any files until it confirms that a valid source file 
has been provided on the command line, or via the interactive prompt.
    
<p>
<li>
<b>ed.ex</b>: <b>ed</b> will only call free_console() at the end of execution
on Linux or FreeBSD. It was causing a slight screen flicker on DOS/Windows, 
and was not necessary.


</ul>

<p>
<font color="#993333"><_sul><b>Bug Fixes</b></_sul></font>

<ul>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: The error traceback from
a bound or shrouded program had garbage showing for the file names and
line numbers. This bug was introduced in the beta release.

<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: 
Bound or shrouded programs were not starting off with a fresh
random seed value. Normal interpreted or translated
programs were OK. Thanks to Michael Bolin.

<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: The error traceback 
could be wrong if you (illegally) tried to pass a sequence as the 
routine id for call_proc/func. Thanks to Mario Steele.

<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: When displaying a large 
variable value during interactive trace, the first few lines might be 
printed in white, while the rest was printed in bright white.
Thanks to Al Getz.

<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: routine_id() of the form:
routine_id("namespace:name") was not working correctly in the interpreter
or in the PD source interpreter. The Translator was ok. 
This worked fine in 2.4 and earlier. Thanks to Verne Tice.

<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: command_line() now shows 
the extra file name when the user types the file name interactively 
at the ex/exw/exu prompt. This is now compatible with 2.4 and earlier.
Thanks to Bob Elia.

<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: 
Warnings were not getting reported when a program ended with a call to abort(),
or it ended with a fatal run-time error. Thanks to Juergen Luethje.

<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: The platform() function 
is now evaluated in backend/backendw/backendu for .il files (rather than
in the front-end of the shrouder). This allows a .il file to be 
portable to multiple platforms. In other situations, the interpreter 
and translator will continue to evaluate platform() in the front-end 
for maximum efficiency. Thanks to Ken Rhodes

</ul>

<p>
<font color="#993333"><_sul><b>Documentation</b></_sul></font>

<ul>
<li>
Many small corrections and improvements were made to the documentation.
Some important ones were provided by Juergen Luethje and Wolfgang Fritz.

<p>
<li>
A paragraph was added to the Reference Manual explaining what happens
when you try to modify a variable by function side-effects at the
same time that you try to modify it via subscripted assignment.
The 2.5 alpha release notes were updated to point out an
incompatibility with 2.4.

</ul>

<p>&nbsp;<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#003366">
<b><_dul>Version 2.5 Beta Release January 14, 2005:</_dul></b></font>

<p>
<font color="#993333"><_sul><b>Improved Performance</b></_sul></font>

<ul>
<li>
The initial parse time (start-up time) of interpreted programs 
has been reduced, typically by 25% 
on newer machines, and 40% on older machines, when compared to 2.5 alpha.
In the case of old machines running very large programs, 
the start-up time can be 65% to 90% less, especially when
<font color="#993333"><_bq>with trace</_bq></font> or
<font color="#993333"><_bq>with profile</_bq></font> are in effect.

<p>
Most of the optimizations were made to the Euphoria front-end 
source that's shared with the Public Domain source interpreter, 
so <b>eu.ex</b> also has reduced parse times.

<p>
<li>
A major speed improvement was made in opASSIGN_SUBS() in the PD source 
interpreter. This operation handles assignments to subscripted sequences,
and is executed a lot. Thanks to Greg Haberek for showing the slowness.

<p>
<li>
<font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font>: In many more cases,
the <font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font> now knows 
the type of all elements of a sequence. This is especially
useful when the elements are known to be integers. Smaller and 
faster code is generated for accessing the elements, and freeing the 
sequence.

<p>
<li>
In most cases, the <font color="#0066CC"><b>Interpreter</b></font> and
the <font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font> now evaluate 
sequence-formation {a, b, c, ...} expressions 
once at compile-time, instead of each time at run-time, when
the elements are all constant integers (either hard-coded numbers or 
symbols declared as constant). This saves time, and also reduces 
code size for translated programs.

<p>
<li>
<font color="#5500FF"><b>database.e</b></font>:
<font color="#006699"><b>db_select_table()</b></font> returns quickly if you
happen to select the table that's already selected. This can save a 
lot of time in situations where it's not convenient for the
application to keep track of which table is currently selected.
Thanks to Derek Parnell.

</ul>
      
<p>
<font color="#993333"><_sul><b>Enhanced Features</b></_sul></font>

<ul>
<li>
The <font color="#0066CC"><b>shrouder</b></font> will now supply a
default <b>#!</b> (shebang) line at the top of 
the <b>.il</b> file, if none was specified. Thanks to Kenneth Rhodes.
      
<p>
<li>
On <font color="#CC3366"><b>Linux</b></font>, the
<font color="#0066CC"><b>shrouder</b></font> will give the <b>.il</b> file
execute permission. Thanks to Kenneth Rhodes.
    
<p>
<li>
On <font color="#CC3366"><b>Linux/FreeBSD</b></font> the
<font color="#0066CC"><b>Binder</b></font> no longer creates bound executable
programs with a ".exe" extension. Now, no extension is used. This is compatible
with the <font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font>, and more in keeping
with the standard on <font color="#CC3366"><b>Linux/FreeBSD</b></font>
systems. Thanks to Jerry Story.

<p>
<li>
<font color="#5500FF"><b>database.e</b></font>: Extra checks were added to
some routines to give a more meaningful error message when no table has been
selected yet. Thanks to Derek Parnell.

<p>
<li>
Several small improvements in the Source Code product and its 
documentation make it easier to compile using Open Watcom and 
other compilers. Thanks to Jean-Marc Duro.

<p>
<li>
The main source file is now closed right after the front-end finishes. 
This allows a program to edit or otherwise modify its own source.

<p>
<li>
The initial random seed value is now chosen more randomly
on <font color="#CC3366"><b>Windows</b></font>. Thanks to Yuku Sugianto.

</ul>

<p>
<font color="#993333"><_sul><b>DOS/Windows Installation Program</b></_sul></font>

<ul>
<li>
The install program will set up ed.bat to run ed.ex with ex.exe on ME/98/95,
and exwc.exe on NT/2000/XP.

<p>
<li>
The <font color="#993333"><b>install</b></font> program will not change any
existing file associations
for Euphoria file types. (If you install Euphoria in a new directory, 
you might have to change these yourself.)
Thanks to Juergen Luethje and others.

<p>
<li>
The Start Menu links created by the <font color="#993333"><b>install</b></font>
program were wrong: exw was incorrectly pointing to
<font color="#993333"><b>ecw.exe</b></font>, and ex was incorrectly pointing 
to <font color="#993333"><b>ec.exe</b></font>. Thanks to Yuku Sugianto.

<p>
<li>
It's ok now to have a blank in the path of the installation directory: 
e.g. "C:\Program Files". Thanks to Rich.
</ul>


<p>
<font color="#993333"><_sul><b>Bug Fixes</b></_sul></font>

<ul>

<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: When building a Linux/FreeBSD
.so file from Euphoria code that contained
<font color="#006699"><b>call_proc()</b></font> or
<font color="#006699"><b>call_func()</b></font>, an undefined "__stdcall" 
symbol appeared in the C file by mistake. Thanks to Matt Lewis. 
 
<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: The opening message displayed
by the Binder on Linux/FreeBSD and on Windows was wrong.
Thanks to Kenneth Rhodes and Igor Kachan.

<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>:
<font color="#006699"><b>routine_id()</b></font> was checking for symbols
coming later in the code. This happened in the Interpreter only, and only
at the top-level, not inside a routine.
<p>
This fix requires .il files shrouded with 2.5 alpha to be reshrouded
with 2.5 beta or later. Bound files are not a problem.

<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: A complex expression on the
left hand side of an assignment, involving nested use of 
<font color="#993333"><_bsq>$</_bsq></font>, could crash. Thanks to Andy Serpa.

<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed - </font> Translator: </b>
A call to <font color="#006699"><b>routine_id()</b></font> 
would sometimes search past the end of a list and start reading garbage
in memory. In most instances this did not cause a problem, but in some
cases it could cause a crash. Thanks to Kenneth Rhodes.

<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed - </font> Translator: </b>
In a rare situation, the 2.5 alpha Translator could crash 
while attempting to optimize some code.
    
<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed - </font> Translator: </b>
In a rare situation, at the end of execution of a particular routine,
the translated code would fail to free some space used for a temporary value.
Thanks to Wolfgang Fritz.
    
<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: After a compile error in
<font color="#993333"><b>exw</b></font> you would have to hit Enter, 
then a message would say: "Press Enter...".
(Things worked properly for run-time errors).  Thanks to Tone Skoda.

<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: An incompatibility existed
between the way that <font color="#006699"><b>abort(1)</b></font> was handled
in the Translator vs the Interpreter. Thanks to Juergen Luethje.
    
<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>:
<font color="#006699"><b>save_text_image()</b></font>,
when run by <font color="#993333"><b>exw</b></font> or
<font color="#993333"><b>exwc</b></font>, occasionally returned some garbage
in the upper bits of the character attributes. Thanks to Brian Broker.
    
<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: The CAPS lock key generated a
key code when using <font color="#993333"><b>ed</b></font> with
<font color="#993333"><b>exwc</b></font>. 
The key had the desired effect, but it caused
<font color="#993333"><b>ed</b></font> to display a message at the top of the
screen. <font color="#993333"><b>ed</b></font> will no longer display the
message. Thanks Alex Caracatsanis.
      
<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>:
<font color="#006699"><b>routine_id("")</b></font> would crash the Binder
and Translator. Thanks to Antonio Alessi.

<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: A line longer than 200 chars
crashed the <font color="#993333"><b>trace</b></font> display. Thanks to
Thomas Betterly.
      
<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: Symbols declared as constant
were not defined in the <font color="#993333"><b>trace</b></font> window.
Thanks to Matthew Lewis.
    
<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>:
<font color="#006699"><b>printf()</b></font> format strings were wrong in
two error messages in <b>execute.e</b> &nbsp;Thanks to Derek Parnell.

<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: The caret (arrow) symbol, 
displayed in compile-time error messages, was shifted one position to the 
right, when compared with version 2.4. This has been corrected. 
Thanks to Juergen Luethje.

<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: For compatibility with
the official Interpreter, routine id's now start at 0
instead of 1 in the PD source interpreter.
    
</ul>

<p>
<font color="#993333"><_sul><b>Documentation</b></_sul></font>
      
<ul>

<li>
A paragraph was added to "Scope" discussing how you can override 
predefined routines with your own variables and routines. 
Thanks to Mike.
  
<p>
<li>
A warning was added to <font color="#006699"><b>open()</b></font> about the
use of CON and CON.*, and other file names that are reserved by DOS.
Thanks to Igor Kachan.

<p>
<li>
The fact that programs are now fully parsed before
being executed was explained better in the Reference Manual.

<p>
<li>
Obsolete uses of the phrase "Complete Edition" were removed from
a few places in the documentation. Thanks to Juergen Luethje.

<p>
<li>
Various documents were fixed where miscellaneous 2.4 information 
has now become now obsolete.
    
<p>
<li>
The Reference Manual said that the limit on nested include files was 10 deep. 
It should have said 30 deep. Thanks to Darkvincentdude.

<p>
<li>
In the PD source interpreter, <b>eu.ex</b>, there was an error in the 
comments at the top. Thanks to Yuku Sugianto.
     
<p>
<li>
The fact that <font color="#006699"><b>crash_message()</b></font> is now only
useful for run-time errors was made clear. Thanks to Juergen Luethje.
     
<p>
<li>
A bad HTML link to the WIN32 API .hlp file was fixed. 
Thanks to "Bro George".

<b><_dul>Version 2.5 Alpha Release November 15, 2004:</_dul></b></font>

<p>
<font color="#993333"><_sul><b>New Features</b></_sul></font>

<ul>
<li>
<font color="#FF8000"><b>Source code for a complete Euphoria
interpreter</b></font>,
100% compatible with the official RDS
<font color="#0066CC"><b>Interpreter</b></font> on all platforms,
is now provided. See <font color="#5500FF"><b>euphoria\source</b></font>.
It's written 100% in Euphoria and has the same front-end as 
the official RDS <font color="#0066CC"><b>Interpreter</b></font>. 
Since it's Public Domain, it may be
used and modified for any purpose, including commercial or 
closed-source applications. It can be bound into a single executable 
file using the <font color="#0066CC"><b>Binder</b></font>, or translated 
with the <font color="#0066CC"><b>Euphoria to C Translator</b></font> to 
get a much faster executable.

<p>
<li>
The official <font color="#0066CC"><b>Euphoria Interpreter</b></font> was
re-written as 30% Euphoria (front-end), 
and 70% hand-coded C (back-end). It was formerly 100% C, and the boundary 
between front-end and back-end was fuzzy. 

<p>
<li>
The <font color="#0066CC"><b>Euphoria Translator</b></font> has been
re-written as 100% Euphoria. It was formerly 100% C. It uses the same 
front-end as the <font color="#0066CC"><b>Interpreter</b></font> and the 
<font color="#0066CC"><b>Binder</b></font>. This reduces future maintenance
costs, and helps catch subtle bugs (subscript out of bounds, uninitialized
variable etc.)

<p>
<li>
The free Public Domain <font color="#0066CC"><b>Interpreter</b></font>
(<font color="#993333"><b>ex.exe</b></font>,
<font color="#993333"><b>exw.exe</b></font>,
<font color="#993333"><b>exu</b></font>), 
now includes full support for <font color="#006699"><b>trace()</b></font>
beyond 300 statements, and for <font color="#993333"><b>profiling</b></font>.
Thus there is no longer a registered "Complete Edition"
interpreter. However, registration is still required for the 
<font color="#0066CC"><b>Binder / shrouder</b></font>.

<p>
<li>
A new <font color="#0066CC"><b>Binder</b></font> was developed 
(100% in Euphoria). Since it shares the
same front-end with the <font color="#0066CC"><b>Interpreter</b></font>
and <font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font>,
possible incompatibilities are avoided, and the future maintenance 
cost has been greatly reduced. 

<p>
<li>
A bound program can now provide a complete 
<font color="#5500FF"><b>ex.err</b></font> dump, without including any lines
of source code in the <b>.exe</b> file.

<p>
<li>
Bound programs now start up immediately with no parsing required.

<p>
<li>
The <font color="#0066CC"><b>Binder</b></font> for 
<font color="#CC3366"><b>Windows</b></font> has a <_bq>-con</_bq>
option, so you can make a console application.

<p>
<li>
A separate <font color="#0066CC"><b>Interpreter back-end executable</b></font>
was developed for use with the <font color="#0066CC"><b>Binder</b></font>.
It executes intermediate code (<b>.il</b> files), 
and is smaller than the <font color="#0066CC"><b>Interpreter</b></font>, 
since it has no front-end (parser).
This reduces the size of bound programs.

<p>
<li>
 A new <font color="#993333"><_bsq>$</_bsq></font> symbol represents the length
 of the current sequence.
 Instead of saying s[length(s)], you can say s[$]. Instead of saying
 s[1..length(s)-1], you can say s[1..$-1]. More complicated expressions
 like s[i][$-5..$-1] are also possible. 
 <p>
 <b>Note:</b> In order to implement
 this feature properly, a small incompatibility with version 2.4 was 
 introduced. A change was made to the order of evaluation of expressions
 in a multiply-subscripted assignment statement:
 <p>
 lhs_var[lhs_expr1][lhs_expr2]... = rhs_expr
 
 <p>
 This change will cause a problem only if you are trying to modify 
 lhs_var via a function call, during the same statement that is
 assigning to lhs_var. You should change your code
 to perform any such function calls before you perform the 
 subscripted assignment, e.g.
 <p>
    temp = rhs_expr<br>
    lhs_var[lhs_expr1][lhs_expr2] = temp <br>

  <p>
  The same would apply if one of the left-hand-side expressions contained
  a function call that tried to modify lhs_var.
  
  <p>
  This situation is very rare (and pretty weird), but a few examples have 
  been found.

<p>
<li>
  Programs now have the ability to get control after a crash 
  (a Euphoria-detected or machine-detected run-time error).
  Using <font color="#006699"><b>crash_routine()</b></font> you can specify
  the routine id's of one or more
  Euphoria routines to be invoked when something goes wrong. You can save
  critical data to disk, inform the user, inform the programmer, etc.

<p>
<li>
 The library routines: <font color="#006699"><b>put_screen_char()</b></font>, 
 <font color="#006699"><b>get_screen_char()</b></font>,
 <font color="#006699"><b>save_text_image()</b></font>
  and <font color="#006699"><b>display_text_image()</b></font> have been
  implemented for <font color="#CC3366"><b>Windows text-mode</b></font> 
  consoles. These functions now work across all platforms. 
  Suggested by C.K. Lester.


<p>
<li>
<font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font>: All the files you need
for translating Euphoria programs to C are now included in the
main download packages for <font color="#CC3366"><b>DOS/Windows</b></font> 
and <font color="#CC3366"><b>Linux/FreeBSD</b></font>. You just need
one or more of the supported free C compilers.

<p>
<li>
<font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font>: The free Public Domain 
<font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font>
(<font color="#993333"><b>ec.exe</b></font>,
<font color="#993333"><b>ecw.exe</b></font>,
<font color="#993333"><b>ecu</b></font>) now includes
Euphoria statements as comments in the C source. It also supports 
<font color="#006699"><b>trace(3)</b></font>
for debugging. When you register, you will eliminate the 
initial message and delay on compiled programs.

<p>
<li>
 <font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font>: 
 Some new optimizations will speed things up, and also reduce 
  the size of the C code. For example the code block:<br>
  <eucode>        if <i>expression</i> then
           ...
           <i>many statements of Euphoria code</i>
           ...
        end if
  </eucode>
  will be completely deleted if the 
  <font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font> can tell that <i>expression</i>
  will always be false. This can lead to further optimizations, such as
  a whole routine being deleted because there are no more calls to it.
  An example where this is useful is when there is different code 
  for different platforms, e.g.<br> 
  <eucode>        if platform() = DOS then ...
  </eucode>
  <font color="#993333"><b>while</b></font> <i>expression</i> and
  <font color="#993333"><b>elsif</b></font> <i>expression</i> can also be 
  optimized in the same way. When the expression is always true, the 
  <font color="#993333"><b>if/while/elsif</b></font> 
  test and jump are eliminated.
  
<p>
<li>
 <font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font>: A couple of additional small improvements were made in 
  converting the source from C to Euphoria. They allow for slightly 
  better optimization.

<p>
<li>
 <font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font>: A minor adjustment lets
  the Translator produce slightly 
  fewer C files, while reducing the slight risk of creating a huge C 
  file that's too big for the C compiler to handle. Also, some empty .c 
  files that were sometimes created, have now been eliminated.
  
<p>
<li>
  <font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font>: The Translator for Windows
  has a new <_bq>-con</_bq> option for making
  a console application.
  It's supported for each of the three Windows C compilers.

<p>
<li>
  <font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font>: After successfully building
  a <b>.exe</b> (or <b>.dll</b>) file,
  <font color="#5500FF"><b>emake.bat</b></font> will delete all the .c
  and .h files that were created
  by the Translator. This reduces clutter in the directory.
  
<p>
<li>
 The <font color="#993333"><b>install</b></font> program for
 <font color="#CC3366"><b>DOS/Windows</b></font>
 automatically creates <font color="#993333"><b>exwc.exe</b></font>, as well
 as <font color="#993333"><b>exw.exe</b></font>.

<p>
<li>
 <font color="#993333"><b>ed</b></font>:
  <font color="#5500FF"><b>ed.bat</b></font> has been changed. It now runs 
  ed.ex using <font color="#993333"><b>exwc.exe</b></font>.
  Instead of using control-Home/control-End to move to the top/bottom 
  of a file, use control-t/control-b.
  On <font color="#CC3366"><b>Windows</b></font> XP, this change gives
  <font color="#993333"><b>ed</b></font>
  faster keyboard response, and full support for long filenames.

<p>
<li>
 <font color="#993333"><b>ed</b></font>: A call to
  <font color="#006699"><b>free_console()</b></font> is made at the very end,
  so you won't see "Press Enter", as occurs on some
  <font color="#CC3366"><b>Linux</b></font> systems.

<p>
<li>
  The <font color="#0066CC"><b>Interpreter</b></font> 
  <font color="#993333"><b>exw</b></font> no longer brings up a blank console
  window while performing <font color="#006699"><b>trace(3)</b></font>.

<p>
<li>
  <font color="#006699"><b>pretty_print()</b></font> has a new option to
  limit the number of lines of output.
  
<p>
<li>
  Both types of slashes (backslash, forward slash) 
  are now fully supported in pathnames on
  <font color="#CC3366"><b>DOS</b></font> and
  <font color="#CC3366"><b>Windows</b></font>.
  Backslash is the standard, but since Windows also supports
  forward slash in most cases, Euphoria also now supports 
  either slash in all situations, not just a few situations as before.
  On <font color="#CC3366"><b>Linux</b></font> and
  <font color="#CC3366"><b>FreeBSD</b></font> only forward slash is supported.
  
<p>
<li>
  The <_bq>-m486</_bq> option was removed from the
  <font color="#5500FF"><b>gnuexu</b></font> batch file used in building the
  Euphoria interpreter on <font color="#CC3366"><b>Linux</b></font>.
  It causes warnings and is not necessary.

<font color="#993333"><_sul><b>Bug Fixes</b></_sul></font>

<ul>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: 
  <font color="#993333"><_bq>with profile</_bq></font> and similar
  <font color="#993333"><b>with/without</b></font> statements
  caused an error when followed immediately by a comment, with no whitespace 
  before the start of the comment. Thanks to Daniel Kluss.

<p>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>:
  <font color="#5500FF"><b>ex.err</b></font> would sometimes report the wrong
  value for a for-loop variable, when the for loop was used during a 
  recursive call. Thanks to Pete Lomax.
  
<p>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: On Windows, using either 
  the Interpreter, or translated code compiled by WATCOM, 
  <font color="#006699"><b>dir()</b></font> caused an exception when given 
  an argument that ended with "*.". This was due to a bug in the WATCOM 
  routine used to implement dir(). Thanks to Daniel Kluss.
  
<p>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: In 2.4, on ME/98/95 the 
  argument to <font color="#006699"><b>dir()</b></font> could no longer be a
  long file (or directory) name.
  This used to work in 2.3. (Note: On XP it can't be long).
  Thanks to Rangi and Juergen Luethje.

<p>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed - </font> Translator: </b>
  On Windows when you create a Euphoria .dll, the global routines need to be
  called using the __stdcall convention. However indirect calls to those 
  routines via <font color="#006699"><b>call_func()</b></font> and 
  <font color="#006699"><b>call_proc()</b></font> from within the 
  same .dll, were using the __cdecl convention. Thanks to Andy Serpa.
    
<p>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: An error message referred to
  "printf()", when it should have referred to "sprintf()". Thanks to Al Getz.
  
<p>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed - </font> safe.e: </b>
  Poking an empty sequence into a 1-byte block 
  of allocated memory caused a false-alarm error message. 
  e.g. allocate_string("") &nbsp;
  Thanks to Bernie Ryan and Josef Jindra.
  
<p>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: If you called 
  <font color="#006699"><b>repeat()</b></font> with a repetition count that
  was extremely close to the maximum size of a Euphoria integer
  (1073741823), you would get a machine exception. You will now get 
  an "Out of memory" error from Euphoria. Thanks to Bob Elia.
    
<p>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed - </font> Translator: </b>
  In some cases, when using the Translator to build 
  a dll, WATCOM C would give the error message "statement required after 
  label" near the end of EuInit(). Lcc also complained. Borland C did not
  complain, and things worked fine. Thanks to Matthew Lewis.

<p>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed - </font> Interpreter: </b>
  In programs larger than a couple of 
  thousand statements, an assignment operation with subscripting 
  on the left might cause a machine exception. The chance of this 
  happening was about 1 in 1000. Any change to the program 
  that shifted the offending statement's position in memory 
  would cause the bug to go away.  For example,<br>
  <eucode>        x[i] -= y
  </eucode>
  This bug has been lurking since January 1999 (version 2.1 alpha).
  The Translator was not affected. Thanks to Pete Lomax.

<p>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>:
  On Windows, Linux and FreeBSD, when reading standard input, and an input
  line was longer than 1040 characters,
  <font color="#006699"><b>gets()</b></font> would set the 1041st character
  to 0. DOS was OK, and files other than standard input were ok.

<p>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed - </font> EDS: </b>
  When <font color="#006699"><b>db_open()</b></font> opened a database file but
  failed to secure an exclusive or shared lock on the file, 
  it was neglecting to close the file before returning a failure code.

<p>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed - </font> ttt.ex: </b>
  A moderately-long human name would damage the 
  board grid. Thanks to Igor Kachan.

<p>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: The line number reported for 
  run-time errors occurring in a short-circuited if-statement 
  could be off slightly. Thanks to Kat.
  
<p>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed - </font> Translator: </b>
  The range of return values assumed for
  <font color="#006699"><b>getc()</b></font> was [0,255]. It should
  have been [-1,255].

<p>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed - </font> Translator: </b>
  The generated C code failed to free the storage for the for-loop variable
  when a return statement was executed inside a for-loop, and the loop variable
  had a non-integer value. A similar problem could occur when there was 
  an <_bq>else</_bq>, <_bq>exit</_bq> or <_bq>end while</_bq> immediately
  after the for-loop, and the loop variable value was not an integer.
</ul>

<font color="#993333"><_sul><b>Documentation</b></_sul></font>

<ul>

<li>
  A document on <a href=cgi.htm>CGI Applications in Euphoria</a> has 
  been added.
<p>
<li>
  Thanks to Kenneth Rhodes,
  <font color="#006699"><b>db_rename_table()</b></font> is now documented. This
  had been accidentally left out of the <font color="#993333"><b>EDS</b></font>
  documentation.

<p>
<li>
  It's now mentioned that format strings 
  in <font color="#006699"><b>pretty_print()</b></font> could have additional
  text along with the format. Thanks to Juergen Luethje.
  
<p>
<li>
  The Reference manual now says that hex literals, such as #FFFFFFFF, are
  never considered to be negative numbers. Thanks to Juergen Luethje.
  
<p>
<li>
  <font color="#006699"><b>sprintf()/printf()</b></font>: It's documented
  that -1 prints as FFFFFFFF in %x format. Thanks to Juergen Luethje.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#003366">
<b><_dul>Version 2.4 Official Release July 3, 2003:</_dul></b></font>

<ul>

<li>
 
<font color="#006699"><b>define_c_proc()</b></font>
and
<font color="#006699"><b>define_c_func()</b></font>
have been extended, so in addition to defining C routines in external 
.dll's and shared libraries, you can now define the parameters 
and return value for a machine-code routine that your program pokes
into its own memory. You can call the machine-code routine using 
<font color="#006699"><b>c_proc()</b></font>
or
<font color="#006699"><b>c_func()</b></font>. Thanks to Daniel Kluss.

<p>
<li>
 Performance Improvement: <font color="#006699"><b>get4()</b></font> and
 <font color="#006699"><b>put4()</b></font> in
 <font color="#5500FF"><b>database.e</b></font> have been 
 speeded up slightly. They are very important to the overall speed of
 <font color="#993333"><b>EDS</b></font>. Thanks to Derek Parnell.

<p>
<li>
 Performance Improvement: <font color="#006699"><b>get_bytes()</b></font>
 is now much faster when the number of bytes requested far exceeds the number
 of bytes remaining in the file. Thanks to Pier Feddema. 

<p>
<li>
 <font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font>: When translating a huge
  Euphoria routine (many hundreds of 
  Euphoria statements), the Translator will now output calls to a 
  dereference routine, rather than using
  in-lined C statements. This reduces the chance of exceeding a
  size limit imposed by the C compiler (especially Watcom C). It also
  reduces the <b>.exe</b> size. Since the dereference routine is more 
  likely than the in-lined statements to be in cache, the speed 
  difference is not that great.

<p>
<li>
 <font color="#0066CC"><b>Interpreter Source Code</b></font>: In
  <font color="#5500FF"><b>watexw.bat</b></font>,
  <b>runtime windows=4.0</b> was added
  to the link command for building <font color="#993333"><b>exw.exe</b></font>.
  
<p>
<li>
 There are now some checks for invalid argument type and invalid
  return type in calls to <font color="#006699"><b>define_c_func()</b></font>
  and <font color="#006699"><b>define_c_proc()</b></font>.

<p>
<li>
 Some syntax error messages are now more descriptive when namespace 
 identifiers are involved.

<p>
<li>
 The filesort.ex tutorial program was altered 
 to make it more usable under Linux and FreeBSD.

<p>
<li>
 By default, <font color="#5500FF"><b>safe.e</b></font> now does a less-strict,
  "edges-only" check for memory corruption, when the platform is
  <font color="#CC3366"><b>WIN32</b></font>.
  Windows programs often access memory that was not allocated using Euphoria's
  <font color="#006699"><b>allocate()</b></font>.
  
<p>
<li>
 <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: When a literal floating-point
  constant in the Euphoria
  program was larger than about 1e308, the Translator would output "inf" 
  in <font color="#5500FF"><b>init_.c</b></font>.
  This caused the C compiler to issue an undefined 
  symbol error. Thanks to Juergen Luethje.

<p>
<li>
 <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: In a rare case, the Translator 
 was failing to emit C code to make a copy of a sequence with multiple 
 references to it, before overwriting an element of that sequence. 
 Thanks to Juergen Luethje. 

<p>
<li>
 <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: In certain cases, when a
  Euphoria program exchanged Euphoria data with a <b>.dll</b> written in
  Euphoria, the data might not be freed (until
  the program terminated). Thanks to Wayne Overman (Euman).
  
<p>
<li>
 <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: If you used "asm" in your
  program, as a private variable or
  parameter name, the Translator would use "_asm" in the C code. 
  This was not acceptable for some C compilers. The Translator will now
  avoid using "_asm", as well as "_try", "_Seg16", "_stdcall" and 
  several other single-underscore names that are reserved by various 
  C compilers. Thanks to George Papadopoulos and Matt Lewis.

<p>
<li>
 <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: If the HOT_KEYS parameter in
  <font color="#5500FF"><b>ed.ex</b></font> was set to FALSE,
  then <b>Esc h Enter</b> would not bring up the help prompt.

<p>
<li>
    <font color="#993333"><b>bind</b></font>
    and <font color="#993333"><b>shroud</b></font> now have an option
    <_bq>-quiet</_bq> that suppresses normal messages

    Only errors are reported. Thanks to Jonas Temple.

<p>
<li>
    The namespace error message that's issued when you refer to a global 
    symbol that's defined in two or more files, now 
    gives you a list of all the files where that symbol 
    has been defined. Thanks to Derek Parnell and Irv Mullins.
  
<p>
<li>
    <font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font>: In many cases,
    the C code generated for <font color="#006699"><b>remainder()</b></font>,

    is smaller and faster.

<p>
<li>
    <b>exw, ecw -wat</b>: Deallocation of space for huge numbers of small

    Thanks to Andy Serpa.
    (Note that <i>allocation</i> of huge numbers of small objects in <b>exw</b>,
    or <b>ecw -wat</b>, became much faster in 2.4 alpha, 
    and remains much faster.)

<p>
<li>

<p>
<li>
    The file name is now included in the warning message that you get for
    some of the common warnings (variable not used, variable not assigned to).

<p>
<li>
    Out-of-bounds floating-point subscript values 
    were being reported after rounding down to an integer. 
    Now the value before rounding is reported.

  Most machine-level exceptions (peek/poke to bad addresses etc.)
  in both the main program and in .dlls, are now caught by
  <font color="#993333"><b>exw</b></font>
  and <font color="#993333"><b>exu</b></font>, 
  and reported in the usual way, with a full traceback and
  <font color="#5500FF"><b>ex.err</b></font> 
  variable dump. This is a great improvement over the cryptic 
  machine-level messages you used to get (and still get when using
  compiled languages, and most interpreted languages) about 
  "segmentation violation", "illegal instruction" etc.). 
  Thanks to Martin Stachon.

<p>
<li>
  In addition to <_bq>__stdcall</_bq>, the C <_bq>__cdecl</_bq> calling
  convention 
  is now supported for calls to C routines in .dll's and also call-backs 
  to Euphoria routines from C code.
  
<p>
<li>
  Euphoria's support for DOS long filenames has been extended to
  Windows XP.

<p>
<li>
  The <font color="#993333"><b>trace</b></font> screen shows you large
  sequences in pretty-print display on a separate
  screen. You can scroll through the whole sequence.
  
<p>
<li>
  <font color="#006699"><b>pretty_print()</b></font> was added to
  <font color="#5500FF"><b>misc.e</b></font>. 
  It lets you display Euphoria objects
  with a nice, readable structured display, and many formatting options.

<p>
<li>
  Pretty-printing of sequences is now done in
  <font color="#5500FF"><b>ex.err</b></font>,
  the <font color="#993333"><b>?</b></font> command, and
  <font color="#006699"><b>db_dump()</b></font>. 
  
<p>
<li>
  <font color="#993333"><b>Euphoria Database System (EDS)</b></font>:
  <font color="#006699"><b>db_rename_table(name, new_name)</b></font>
  was added to <font color="#5500FF"><b>database.e</b></font>.
  This routine was submitted by Jordah Ferguson, and included 
  with only trivial changes.

<p>
<li>
  <font color="#CC3366"><b>Linux/FreeBSD</b></font>:
  <font color="#006699"><b>system()</b></font> no longer initializes
  curses when there is no console window yet. Thanks to Daniel Johnson.

<p>
<li>
  The number of levels of nested include files has been raised to 30 (from 10).
  Thanks to Tone Skoda.

<p>
<li>
  Include statement path names can have double-quotes around them, 
  so paths containing blanks can be handled correctly. This was 
  actually implemented for 2.3 but never documented.

<p>
<li>
  <font color="#993333"><b>exw.exe</b></font>, and any executables
  produced by the <font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font> with Watcom,
  now have the subsystem set to 4.0 instead of 3.1. This improves the
  appearance of GUI's in some cases. The utility
  <font color="#993333"><b>make31.exw</b></font> will 
  create a version of <font color="#993333"><b>exw.exe</b></font> that
  supports Windows GUI 3.1 as before, 
  in the unlikely case that there are compatibility problems with
  Euphoria 2.3. Thanks to H. W. Overman, Brian Broker and others for 
  recommending this change.

<p>
<li>
  <font color="#993333"><b>makecon.exw</b></font> - will create a version
  of <font color="#993333"><b>exw.exe</b></font> that
  operates as a console application - no console window is popped up,
  and <b>stdin/stdout</b> can be redirected

<p>
<li>
  <font color="#006699"><b>trace(1 2 and 3)</b></font> are now allowed
  with <b>bind -clear</b>
  (still not allowed with <font color="#993333"><b>shrouded bind</b></font>
  for security reasons). Thanks to Jonas Temple.

<p>
<li>
  <font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font>: You can now make a
  Euphoria .dll using Lcc and interface it with interpreted programs running
  under <font color="#993333"><b>exw</b></font>, and translated programs
  using Borland and Watcom. Previously, the main program had to also be
  compiled with Lcc.
  
<p>
<li>
  The <font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font> no longer uses
  the <b>-m486</b> or <b>-mpentium</b> options available with
  GCC and DJGPP.
  These options were causing warnings, and the C compiler apparently
  sets the machine model correctly by itself. Thanks to Kenneth Rhodes.

<p>
<li> 
  The <font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font> will now perform 
  automatic calls
  to user-defined types, in the
  unusual case where the type routine has side-effects (it sets global
  variables, performs I/O etc.). Thanks to Andy Serpa.

<p>
<li>  
  <font color="#5500FF"><b>euphoria\demo\bench</b></font> compares 
  the 
  <font color="#0066CC"><b>Euphoria Interpreter</b></font> and the
  <font color="#0066CC"><b>Euphoria To C Translator</b></font> against
  more than 20 other interpreted languages.

</ul>  

<p>
<font color="#993333"><_sul><b>Porting Activity</b></_sul></font>
<ul>
<li>
  We ported the <font color="#0066CC"><b>Interpreter</b></font>
  and <font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font>
  to <font color="#CC3366"><b>FreeBSD.</b></font>
  The source now has several C #ifdef's for FreeBSD.
  
<p>
<li>
  Andy Cranston has ported Euphoria to HP Unix, and he plans to do 
  Sun Unix.

</ul>

<p>
<font color="#993333"><_sul><b>Optimizations</b></_sul></font>
	
<p>
<font color="#339900"><b>- Interpreter -</b></font>
  
<ul>
<li>
  Typical large slices are faster.
  About 30% faster for slices from about 100 to 50000 in length.
  (Overhead dominates for smaller slices, and lack of caching
  affects larger slices.)
  This assumes the slice is mostly integers (usually true), 
  and an actual copy of the data is made (usually true since v1.4b).
  
<p>
<li>
  Statements that contain multiple <font color="#993333"><_bsq>&</_bsq></font>
  concatenations are much faster. <br>
  <pre>        e.g. instead of:
             <b>result = a & b & c</b>
             being evaluated as:
               1. copy a and b into temp
               2. copy temp and c into result 
                  (a and b are effectively copied twice!)
  
             We now do:
               1. copy a and b and c directly into result
  </pre>
  So there is less copying of data and fewer temp sequences to create.
  The more <font color="#993333"><_bsq>&</_bsq></font> operators in an
  expression, the greater the speed-up. e.g. with 3
  <font color="#993333"><_bsq>&</_bsq></font> operators some of the data
  was copied 3 times, etc.
  Jordah Ferguson pointed out that this was slow.

<p>
<li>
  The time overhead involved in calling and returning from a 
  Euphoria call-back routine has been reduced by about 10 percent.

<p>
<li>
  In <b>exw</b> and <b>ecw -wat</b>, allocation of space for large numbers of 
  objects is faster. It can be tremendously faster when hundreds of
  thousands or millions of objects are involved.
  
<p>
<li>
  Better UPX compression has chopped a few K off
  <font color="#993333"><b>exw.exe</b></font> vs. 2.3 
  (even though new code was added). Thanks to Wolfgang Fritz

</ul>

  <p>
  <font color="#339900"><b>- Euphoria Database System -</b></font>

<ul>

<li>
  Keys and records are read faster due to a faster
  <font color="#006699"><b>decompress()</b></font> routine.
  Almost twice as fast when the key or record data to be retrieved 
  consists mainly of sequences of characters or small integers. 
  This case is quite common.
   
<p>
<li>
  Allocating new space in a database is much faster, up to 4x faster,
  especially in large databases with a large list of free blocks
     
<p>
<li>
  Inserting and deleting records in huge tables is now much faster. 
  Combined with the speeded-up slices in Euphoria 2.4,
  <font color="#5500FF"><b>database.e</b></font> is
  now about 25% faster for a table with 10,000 records and 
  over 3x faster for a table with 100,000 records.
  This really only matters if you are trying to insert/delete hundreds
  of records per second. In the typical case of a human operator
  entering data via GUI, you would never notice the insert/delete time
  for one record (a few milliseconds). Derek Parnell pointed out the
  slowness.

<p>
<li>
  <font color="#006699"><b>db_select_table()</b></font> is significantly
  faster.

<p>
<li>
  <font color="#006699"><b>get4()</b></font> is faster which speeds up
  everything.
     
</ul>

  <p>
  <font color="#339900"><b>- Other Optimizations -</b></font>

<ul>

<li>
  <font color="#006699"><b>bytes_to_int()</b></font> in
  <font color="#5500FF"><b>machine.e</b></font> is now more than twice as fast.

<p>
<li>
  <font color="#006699"><b>gets()</b></font> is about 5% faster

<p>
<li>
  <font color="#006699"><b>sort()</b></font> and
  <font color="#006699"><b>custom_sort()</b></font> are a few percent faster.
  Thanks to Ricardo Forno for tweaking the Shell sort algorithm. 
  
<p>
<li>
  Several additional optimizations have been added to the
  <font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font>.
  It produces executables that are faster and smaller 
  than version 2.3. The 2.4 Translator has been successfully tested 
  on hundreds of thousands of lines of Euphoria code, and there are
  currently no known code generation bugs. Some Translator 
  benchmark results are in
  <font color="#5500FF"><b>euphoria\demo\bench</b></font>.

<p>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: Karl Bochert pointed out a necessary C coding 
  change to make <font color="#006699"><b>poke()</b></font> work with
  the latest version of Lcc. The change 
  corrected the <font color="#0066CC"><b>Translator</b></font> (with
  recent versions of Lcc) and the <font color="#0066CC"><b>Interpreter

<ul>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: A crash might occur in situations where a call-back routine
  indirectly called itself recursively. Thanks to Matthew Lewis 
  and George Papadopoulos.

<p>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: In for-loops at the top-level of a program 
  (outside of any routine), 
  that incremented the loop variable by an integer other than the default 
  of +1, <font color="#993333"><_bq>end for</_bq></font> was taking up to
  15x longer than necessary due to a 
  bug fix that was made back in November 1999. Only the
  <font color="#993333"><_bq>end for</_bq></font>
  itself was slow, not the code contained in the body of the loop.
  Antoine Tammer detected this.

<p>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: On XP, when you open a new DOS window that has more than 25 lines,
  the Virtual DOS Machine (VDM) is at first confused about the true number
  of lines. The first time (only) when you ran a Euphoria program in 
  that window, if you ran it near the very bottom of the screen, the output 
  might disappear, or the VDM or Euphoria might report an error etc. 
  Euphoria (<font color="#993333"><b>ex.exe</b></font>) now detects the
  rare cases when VDM is
  confused and clears the screen, which clears up the confusion. 
  A similar problem existed on NT, and was fixed a few years ago.

<p>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: The interpreter was referring
  to "call back from Windows" in <font color="#5500FF"><b>ex.err</b></font>,
  even on Linux or FreeBSD. It now says "call-back from external source"
  on those systems. Thanks to Pete Eberlein.
  
<p>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: When an include file couldn't
  be found, the error message 
  referred to "euphoria\include". It now uses %EUDIR%\include
  
<p>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: An error message will no longer be generated on any platform 
  for <_bq>without profile_time</_bq>. Thanks to Alan Oxley.
</ul>

  <p>
  <font color="#339900"><b>- Translator -</b></font>

<ul>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: When assigning
  the result of an arithmetic calculation (typically multiply) 
  involving two integers, to a variable declared as atom, 
  where the atom variable had already (in the same basic block) 
  been assigned an integer value, the Translator might 
  not output any code to check for integer overflow (result outside
  of +/- one billion). This could cause a crash. Thanks to Andy Serpa.

<p>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: DJGPP strip.exe command
  in <font color="#5500FF"><b>emake.bat</b></font> would fail on XP,2000 due to
  a bug in DJGPP.
  Now <font color="#5500FF"><b>emake.bat</b></font> has: <b>SET LFN=n</b>
  to work around the bug in strip.exe  

<p>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: Translated code compiled
  with Borland C was not producing 
  INF's and NAN's, like Watcom and Lcc. Rather, it was crashing when
  a floating-point overflow (over 1e308), or an undefined f.p. 
  result was calculated. The <font color="#0066CC"><b>Interpreter Source
  Code</b></font> was also 
  corrected for those who wish to compile <font color="#993333"><b>exw.exe</b>
  </font> using Borland.
  Thanks to Andy Serpa.
  
<p>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: In the first basic block
  of a Euphoria routine (i.e. before any control-flow statements),
  <font color="#006699"><b>peek4u()</b></font>, <font color="#006699">
  <b>peek4s()</b></font>, and the
  "add integer 1" operation, would sometimes neglect to check for 
  possible 31-bit integer overflow when assigning to a private variable 
  declared as atom, unless the variable had been previously
  initialized. Thanks to Mike Duffy.

<p>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: In some cases, when
  assigning a sequence element
  to a variable declared as integer, and known to have an integer value
  at this point, the case where the element was an integer value stored
  in C double form was not handled correctly.

<p>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: In rare cases, the
  translator might output two unary minus operators
  in a row, which would be parsed by a C compiler as the 
  C decrement operator "--".

<p>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: Euphoria .dll's were not
  always correctly freeing storage
  allocated by the main program, and vice versa. Memory could be wasted,
  and you might get a machine-level crash. Thanks to H. W. Overman.
  <p>
  <b>Note:</b> Due to this fix, any Euphoria .dll's created with the 
  Translator version 2.3 or earlier, must be re-translated with 2.4, 
  and re-compiled, in order to interface with the Euphoria 2.4 (or later) 
  interpreter or translated code. New .dll's created with version 2.4 
  or later, will not work with the interpreter version 2.3 or earlier, 
  except in trivial cases.

<p>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: The
  <font color="#006699"><b>sleep(x)</b></font> function was only sleeping
  for x milliseconds 
  when using the Lcc run-time library. It now sleeps for x seconds, 
  to conform with the Euphoria documentation for

<p>
<li>
  <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font></b>: On some versions of Linux, a translated/compiled Euphoria

 The DJGPP version of the interpreter source code now uses 
 GNU C's dynamic labels, just like the Linux version. This allows
 it to achieve full speed, without the need for any assembly-level 
 tweaking. Thanks to Bernie Ryan.

<p>
<li>
 The Interpreter Source Code now includes an overview document
 describing how the interpreter works.
 
<p>
<li>
 In the Complete Edition, bind.bat and bindw.bat now use exw to run
 the binder/shrouder. This avoids problems with long filenames
 on some systems. A console window will appear while the binder/shrouder
 is running. Thanks to "void", Bruce Axtens, and others.

<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed </font>: </b>
 Due to a bug in the WATCOM 10.6 C library, the ex and exw interpreters,
 and code translated to C and compiled by Watcom, might get the wrong
 result from Euphoria's where() function when the file was opened in 
 append mode, and the file pointer was in the uncommitted (not written 
 to disk yet) portion of the file. The bug has been worked around 
 by having Euphoria flush() the file in this particular case, 
 before calling the Watcom routine. Thanks to Bob Elia.

<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed </font>: </b>
 A bug introduced in the binder for 2.3 beta, might cause
 a function call on the last line of a program to be ignored.
 Thanks to Wolfgang Fritz.

<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed </font>: </b>
 Several Euphoria files in the WIN32+DOS32 distribution had Linux-style
 line terminators (\n only). This made them hard to view using 
 NotePad and some other editors. Thanks to Pete Lomax.

<b><_dul>Version 2.3 Beta Release January 15, 2002:</_dul></b></font>
<p>
This release updates the Euphoria Interpreter, 
the Euphoria To C Translator, and the Interpreter Source Code product,
for all platforms.
<ul>

<p>
<li>
  You can now override a Euphoria built-in routine with your own
  variable or namespace identifier of the same name. 
  Previously this was only allowed for user-defined routines.
  Besides giving programmers more freedom, it will allow RDS
  to add new built-in routines in the future without breaking 
  existing code.

<p>
<li>
  The warning about having multiple global symbols with the same name
  in different source files has been removed. It was felt to be unnecessary 
  since you'll be asked to supply a namespace identifier if you actually 
  make an ambiguous reference to a global symbol.

<p>
<li>
  You can now have a trailing \ (or Linux /) on the end of all directory names 
  in <b>EUINC</b>, and you can have blanks in the directory name.

<p>
<li>
  To eliminate confusion, the binder/shrouder will now delete the 
  output file if a fatal error occurs during the bind or shroud.

<p>
<li>
  Numerous improvements and corrections were made to the documentation.
  Thanks to Igor Kachan.

<p>
<li>
  Old, pre-ANSI function definitions in the interpreter source code,
  have been updated to ANSI-style, which is more compatible with C++.

<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed </font>: </b>
  With DJGPP C, when compiling code produced by the Translator, 
  or compiling the Interpreter source code, 
  there was a memory allocation bug that could waste a bit of time, 
  or, in rare cases, cause a crash.

<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed </font>: </b>
  On Windows, using the Interpreter, or a Translated program, you were 
  sometimes required to hit Enter twice to exit from a console window. 
  Thanks to Tone Skoda.

<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font>: </b>
   The Euphoria dir() function, as implemented for Lcc or Borland,
   did not handle directories properly when they had extra attributes
   set, such as READ_ONLY. Thanks to Euman, who encountered the problem,
   and then showed how to fix the Interpreter source code for dir().
<p>

<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed</font>: </b>
  You can now declare a namespace identifier with the same name as a built-in function,
  without causing a lot of errors. Thanks to Martin Stachon 
  (although he recommended a different solution).
  
<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed - </font> Binder: </b>
 Support for the new <b>EUINC</b> environment variable
 has now been added to the binder. Thanks to Ross Boyd. 

<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed - </font> Binder: </b>
  Appending resource files to a bound .exe didn't work
  correctly when bind -clear was used. Thanks to Wolfgang Fritz. 

<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed - </font> Binder: </b>
 When using the binder interactively, you would get a
 "variable not initialized" error when trying to substitute a
 different Windows icon. Thanks to Tony Steward.

<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed - </font> Binder: </b>
 In some cases the keyword "constant" would be dropped from 
 the shrouded output, when the previous line of input had a 
 constant declaration ending in ']'. Thanks to Ross Boyd.

<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed - </font> Binder: </b>
When a general expression, (not just a string in quotes), 
was used as the argument to routine_id(), local routines that were
potentially the target of that expression, might have their
names changed (unless -clear was used), thus causing routine_id()
to return -1 at run-time. Global routines were ok.

<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed - </font> Binder: </b>
The binder/shrouder kept going even though an include file was missing.
Thanks to Ross Boyd.

<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed - </font> Linux Binder:</b>
 The Linux search path bug for bound executables, supposedly fixed
 by the 2.3 alpha release, wasn't fixed properly. Fixed now.
 Thanks to Kenneth Rhodes. 

<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed - </font> Linux Binder:</b>
  bindu -clear  and shroud -clear with a file containing 
  DOS/Windows-style \r\n line terminators gave you errors 
  "illegal character" when your shrouded program was run, 
  and "not bound correctly" when your bound file was run. 

<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#009999">bug fixed - </font> Interpreter Source:</b>
  The link command for building the DOS interpreter with WATCOM C,
  listed a non-existent .obj file.

</ul>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#003366">
<b><_dul>Version 2.3 Alpha Release November 30, 2001:</_dul></b></font>
<p>
This release updates the Euphoria Interpreter for WIN32, DOS32 and Linux.
It also updates the Euphoria To C Translator for all platforms, 
and it introduces a new product - the Euphoria Interpreter Source Code.

<ul>
<p>
<li>
The registration incentives and prices have changed.
<ul>
<p>
<li>The Interpreter product now has just one option: 
   WIN32, DOS32 <i>and</i> Linux, formerly $59, for just $39.

<p>
<li>The Interpreter source code (minus a few registered features)
    is now available for $49. See the <a href=license.htm>source license</a>
    and <a href=register.htm>register.doc</a> for more details.
<p>
<li>
The Translator continues to cost $29.

<p>
<li> When Public Domain users reach 300 statements, they will no longer
lose the run-time error diagnostics. They will only lose the trace() facility.

</ul>
<p>
<a href=register.htm>register.doc</a> has more details, including the
requirements for getting a free upgrade.

<p>
<li> 
 The Euphoria interpreter can now be built successfully by 6 different 
 C compilers on 3 platforms.

<p>
<li> 
 New <i>namespace qualifiers</i> eliminate naming conflicts
 between identical global symbols declared in different include files.
 Also, local symbols will now override global symbols of the same name,
 rather than causing an error. See <a href=refman_2.htm#42>Scope Rules</a>.

<p>
<li> 
 The Complete Edition Interpreter product comes with a new 
 2-pass binder/shrouder that eliminates all unused routines and constants,
 resulting in smaller executable files. It also has an option to bind 
 clear source, so you can get understandable error messages from your users.
 
<p>
<li> 
 A new environment variable, EUINC, has been introduced.
 If present, it specifies a list of additional directories that will be
 searched for include files. The directory containing the main file 
 is always searched first, then the directories in EUINC, 
 then euphoria\include.

<p>
<li> 
 The Interpreter now supports a new trace mode, trace(3).
 It logs all executed Euphoria statements to a file, so 
 you'll be able to see the last statement that was 
 executed at the time of any crash, as well as the 499 statements 
 that preceded it.
 This is particularly helpful in the case of machine-level crashes
 where Euphoria is unable to write an ex.err file.
 Thanks to Matthew Lewis.

<p>
<li> 
 The Euphoria interpreter can now pass Euphoria data - 
 atoms and sequences, to .dll files coded in Euphoria and built 
 by the Translator. Use the new E_ types in dll.e
  
<p>
<li> 
 On Linux we added RTLD_GLOBAL on the dlopen() call. This lets you link
 successfully with more shared libraries.
   
<p>
<li> 
 On Linux, when using the #! feature on the first line, 
 to make your source file directly executable, 
 you no longer need a .exu extension on your file.
 Linux programmers often prefer to have no extension on their executable files.

<p>
<li> 
  Windows callback routines written in Euphoria can now take 9
  arguments (was 8). Thanks to Matt Lewis.

<p>
<li> 
  In addition to C_DOUBLE (8-byte floating point), C_FLOAT 
  (4-byte floating-point) is now supported for arguments and 
  return values from C routines. Thanks to David Guy.
  
<p>
<li> 
  Windows .dlls opened with open_dll() are now closed automatically
  when your program terminates. This avoids a tiny bit of memory leakage.
  Thanks to Euman.
  
<p>
<li> 
  safe.e has a new option to check just the edges of registered blocks
  and not complain if other blocks of memory are used.

<p>
<li> 
  get_bytes() is 30% faster.

<p>
<li> 
  allocate_string() was speeded up. Thanks to Yuku Sugianto.

<p>
<li> 
  The mydata.ex demo program now uses an EDS database.
    
<p>
<li>
 <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed - </font> Translator: </b> 
  When a global or local variable containing a sequence or floating-point
  number was assigned the result of a function,
  and at some point during the function call 
  the global or local variable was overwritten, 
  some corruption would take place, leading to a probable
  crash later in the program. Thanks to Sergio Gelli.

<p>
<li><b><font color="#009999">bug fixed - </font> Linux Interpreter: </b>
programs of more than a few thousand lines had a chance (maybe 20%)
of having one of their statements crash whenever it was executed.

<p>
<li><b><font color="#009999">bug fixed - </font>Interpreter: </b> <b>s[i][j]...[k] = s</b>
 caused the interpreter to crash. i.e. an assignment of an entire sequence 
 to an element of an element of itself using 2 or more levels of 
 subscripting. Thanks to Henri Goffin.

<p>
<li><b><font color="#009999">bug fixed - </font> Linux binder: </b> (Kenneth Rhodes)  
  Bound executable programs stored somewhere on the search path
  would not run properly unless they were in the current directory
  or unless you specified the full path to the executable.
   
<p>
<li><b><font color="#009999">bug fixed - </font> Binder: </b> "with profile_time" in a 
bound or shrouded program would cause a crash

<p>
<li><b><font color="#009999">bug fixed - </font> DOS Interpreter: </b> In image.e,
 put_screen_char() has been corrected to have:
  <b>if overflow > 0 then ...</b> instead of: <b> if overflow then ... </b>

<p>
<li><b><font color="#009999">bug fixed - </font> Interpreter: </b> 
  A time optimization for slicing could in rare cases cause a lot of
  wasted space. The optimization has been adjusted to handle those cases.
  Thanks to Brian Clausing.

<p>
<li><b><font color="#009999">bug fixed - </font>safe.e: </b> free() and free_low() 
were not actually freeing the block of memory, and on Linux free() 
could cause a segmentation violation. The same routines in

<p>
<li><b><font color="#009999">bug fixed - </font>Translator for DJGPP: </b>A

<b><_dul>Version 2.2 Beta Release for WIN32+DOS32 December 23, 1999:</_dul></b></font>
<p>
Most of the new library routines developed for Euphoria 2.2 on 
Linux, have now been ported to WIN32 and DOS32. 
These are: sleep(), chdir(), flush(), lock_file(), unlock_file(),
crash_file(), get_screen_char() and put_screen_char(). For a
description of these routines refer to the Linux release notes below,
or <a href=library.htm>LIBRARY.DOC</a>.

<p>
Some cross-platform bug fixes and other miscellaneous improvements 
were made during the Linux port. These bug fixes and improvements
have now been ported back to WIN32+DOS32. See the Linux release notes (below).

<p>
In addition, the following improvements have been made specifically 
for WIN32 and DOS32:
<ul>
<p>
<li> <b>exw.exe</b> now contains a Euphoria icon that is displayed 
automatically by Windows. The icon was contributed by Gary Dumer.
Registered users may change this icon when they bind a program.
<p>
<li> <b>exw.exe</b> is now a compressed executable of just 73K (or so).
It's compressed using the UPX compression tool for .exe files.
<p>
<li> <b>ex.exe</b> has been updated with the latest release of 
the CauseWay DOS extender. A problem where
CauseWay would sometimes limit you to 64Mb of memory under
some DOS configurations has been eliminated, and a few other minor
bugs were fixed.
<p>
<li> <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed:</font></b>
The error traceback could sometimes crash or be misprinted when
a type_check failure occurred. It could only happen when 1 was added to
an expression, and the non-integer result of the expression 
was assigned to a variable declared as integer.
<p>
<li> <b><font color="#009999">bug fixed:</font></b>
If text_rows() was called as the first routine needing a WIN32 console
window, Euphoria would fail to set the new number of lines of
text on the console.

<ul>
<li> <b>All platforms: <font color="#009999">bug fixed:</font></b>
If a Euphoria routine called itself recursively from inside a
for-loop, and at one level of recursion the for-loop counted <i>up</i> 
to an upper limit, and at another level of recursion the for-loop 
counted <i>down</i> to a 
lower limit, the for-loop would probably malfunction at one of the levels.
Thanks to Delroy Gayle.

to the Linux platform.

a rectangular text image from the screen.
<p>
<li>
<font color="#006699"><b>display_text_image()</b></font> now works under Linux (as well as DOS32). 
It writes a rectangular text image to the screen.
<p>

  possibly short-circuited call. Minor clarifications were made in some 
  other error messages as well.
<p>
<li>
Minor improvements were made to <b>ed</b> and <b>search</b>.
<p>
<li>
A portability problem in <b>how2reg.ex</b> was fixed.

<ul>
<li>
 You can call C routines in <font color="#CC3366"><b>Linux</b></font>
  shared libraries (<b>.so</b> files). See
  <font color="#5500FF"><b>euphoria/demo/linux/callc.exu</b></font> for
  some examples.
<p>
<li>
 If your program does not output anything to the <b>xterm</b> window, 
  <font color="#993333"><b>exu</b></font> will not issue the "Press Enter"
  prompt.
<p>
<li>
  <b>All platforms: <font color="#993333">ed</font></b> now lets you recall
   previous top-line command text using <b>up-arrow</b> and <b>down-arrow</b>,
   similar to doskey in DOS and the shell history in Linux. This works with
   any strings that you type for <b>Esc n</b> (new file),
   <b>Esc d</b> (Linux command), <b>Esc f</b> (find string) or
   <b>Esc r</b> (replace string). In addition, you can now use
   <b>arrow keys</b>, <b>Home</b>, <b>End</b>, <b>Delete</b> etc. to edit
   strings before you press <b>Enter</b>. 
</ul>

 In an <b>xterm</b> window, <font color="#993333"><b>exu</b></font> will
  prompt you to hit <b>Enter</b> before it exits. Without this, <b>xterm</b>
  restores the screen so fast that you don't see any output or error messages.
<p>
<li>
 An internal coding change was made to Euphoria's
  <font color="#006699"><b>rand()</b></font> function. 
  (The algorithm has not changed.)
  Hopefully this will
  allow <font color="#006699">rand()</font> to work on all distributions of

</b></font>

<ul>
<li>
  Updates to the <font color="#993333"><b>trace</b></font> screen have been
  optimized. Unnecessary refreshes of the source code, and the variables on
  the trace screen, have been eliminated. When a refresh is necessary, it is
  now slightly faster. This makes a noticeable difference in
  <font color="#993333"><b>exw.exe</b></font>, and also in
  <font color="#993333"><b>ex.exe</b></font> in
  <font color="#CC3366">pixel-graphics modes</font>. For 
  <font color="#993333"><b>ex.exe</b></font> in 
  <font color="#CC3366">text modes</font>, it reduces screen flicker 
  slightly.
<p>
<li>
  The <font color="#993333"><b>install</b></font> program no longer requires 
  that your PATH be less than 128 characters. It will simply warn you if it 
  isn't. Newer versions of DOS allow for a longer PATH. Thanks to Steve Adams.

<li>
  The rest of the files in the <font color="#5500FF"><b>euphoria\doc</b></font>
  directory have now been converted to HTML. Every <b>.doc</b> file in the
  <font color="#5500FF"><b>doc</b></font> directory now has a corresponding
  <b>.htm</b> file in the <font color="#5500FF"><b>euphoria\html</b></font>

<p>
<li>
  <font color="#5500FF"><b>safe.e</b></font> no longer includes

  substituted for <font color="#5500FF"><b>machine.e</b></font>.
<p>
<li>
  Using code supplied by David Guy, <font color="#5500FF"><b>safe.e</b></font>
  will now let you add or remove externally-allocated blocks of memory on

<p>
<li>
  <font color="#006699"><b>message_box()</b></font> now uses the <b>handle of

  or your <font color="#993333"><b>ex.exe</b></font>,
  <font color="#993333"><b>exw.exe</b></font>,

  some more. Thanks to Rusty Davis.
<p>
<li>
  To save space in <b>euphor21.zip</b>, the
  <font color="#993333"><b>install</b></font> program now <i>generates</i> the
  HTML and DOC files from a common source, using Junko Miura's
  <font color="#993333"><b>documentation generator</b></font>. In the process,
  the generator is deleted, but you can download it from the RDS site.
<p>
<li>
  When a <font color="#993333"><b>type_check</b></font> failure occurs
  you'll be warned if the type erroneously returned a <i>sequence</i> for it's
  "true/false" result. Previously, a sequence result was simply reported
  as a type_check failure. Suggested by Ralf Nieuwenhuijsen.
<p>
<li>
 The code for <font color="#5500FF"><b>demo\win32\winwire.exw</b></font> was
 cleaned up considerably.

<b><_dul>Version 2.1 alpha-test release January 15, 1999:</_dul></b></font>

<ul>
<li>
 We've made a number of changes to the packaging, pricing, and registration
 incentives for the Euphoria product:

<ul>
<p>
<li>
     The Dual-Platform (DOS32+WIN32) package, formerly $53 has been reduced
     to $39 U.S., effective immediately.
<p>
<li>
     The Single-Platform (DOS32-only) package, formerly $32, has been
     discontinued.
<p>
<li>
     The printed manual has been discontinued. Instead, there is now an
     official HTML version of the manual, included with the Public Domain
     .zip file.
<p>
<li>
     All useful 3rd-party include files, such as <b>Win32Lib.ew</b> and many
     others, will be "stamped" by RDS with a code number that makes them
     <font color="#CC0099"><b><i>free</i></b></font>, just like the files in
     <font color="#5500FF"><b>euphoria\include</b></font>. They will not 
     add to your statement count, provided you do not significantly modify
     them. This will also allow 3rd-party developers to get better diagnostic
     information from their users.
<p>
<li>
     <font color="#993333"><b>Binding</b></font>,
     <font color="#993333"><b>shrouding</b></font> and
     <font color="#993333"><b>profiling</b></font> will now be part of the
     Complete Edition only. These are features that beginners do not require,
     but serious users might find valuable.

</ul>

<p>
<li>
 Short-form assignment operators <font color="#993333"><b>&nbsp; += &nbsp;
 -= &nbsp; *= &nbsp; /= &nbsp; &= &nbsp;</b></font> have been added. 
 For example, instead of saying:
<eucode>
           count = count + 1
</eucode>
 You can now say:
<eucode>
           count += 1
</eucode>

 Instead of saying:
<eucode>
           matrix[row][column] = matrix[row][column] * 5.0
</eucode>
 You can say:
<eucode>
           matrix[row][column] *= 5.0
</eucode>

 Instead of saying:
<eucode>
           test_scores[start..finish] = test_scores[start..finish] / 100
</eucode>
 You can say:
<eucode>
           test_scores[start..finish] /= 100
</eucode>
 See <a class="blue" href="refman_2.htm#assignop">
 <b>refman.doc</b></a> for the details.

<p>
<li>
 Euphoria now uses "short-circuit" evaluation of
 <font color="#993333"><_bq>and</_bq></font> and
 <font color="#993333"><_bq>or</_bq></font> expressions in
 <font color="#993333"><b>if/elsif/while</b></font> conditions.
 e.g. in an <font color="#993333"><_bq>and</_bq></font> condition:
<eucode>
           if A and B then ...
</eucode>
   the interpreter will skip the evaluation of expression B whenever 
   expression A is 0 (false), since it knows that the overall result
   must be false. In an <font color="#993333"><_bq>or</_bq></font> condition:
<eucode>
           while A or B do ...
</eucode>
   the interpreter will skip the evaluation of expression B whenever
   expression A is non-zero (true), since it knows that the overall result
   must be true.
<p>
   Euphoria code written prior to version 2.1 may no longer work correctly if
   expression B contains a function with <b><i>side-effects</i></b> such as
   setting a global variable, doing I/O etc. In practice this kind of code is
   very rare, but just in case, a warning will now be issued if a function
   with side-effects might be short-circuited. 
<p>
   By skipping the evaluation of B, short-circuit evaluation is typically
   faster, and will allow you to write statements such as:
<eucode>
           if atom(x) or length(x)=1 then ...
</eucode>
   that would generate an error on older versions of Euphoria whenever x
   was an <font color="#993333"><b>atom</b></font>, since
   <font color="#006699">length()</font> is not defined for atoms.
<p>

<p>
   See <a class="blue" href="library.htm"><b>library.doc</b>
   </a> for the details.

<p>
<li>
 The main Euphoria documentation can now be viewed locally with a Web 
   browser. The plain-text files <font color="#5500FF"><b>refman.doc</b></font>
   and <font color="#5500FF"><b>library.doc</b></font> are still 
   available in the <font color="#5500FF"><b>doc</b></font> subdirectory,
   but we now have <font color="#5500FF"><b>refman.htm</b></font> and 
   <font color="#5500FF"><b>library.htm</b></font> in the new
   <font color="#5500FF"><b>html</b></font> subdirectory. We have developed
   a tool (written in Euphoria) that lets us easily maintain both an
   up-to-date HTML version, and an up-to-date plain-text version of
   <font color="#5500FF"><b>refman</b></font> and
   <font color="#5500FF"><b>library</b></font>.
<p>  
   The documentation has also been clarified and expanded in many places.

<p>
<li>
 <font color="#CC3366"><b>WIN32:</b></font> you can create an
 <font color="#CC0099"><b>unlimited</b></font> number of Euphoria
 call-back routines,
   as long as each routine is a function with 0 to 8 parameters. 
   See <a class="blue" href="platform.htm#callback">
   <b>platform.doc</b></a>. In version 2.0 you could only have one
   call-back routine and it had to have exactly 4 parameters.

<p>
<li>
 The <font color="#993333"><_bq>xor</_bq></font> keyword has been added to
  complement: <font color="#993333"><b>and/or/not</b></font> and
  <font color="#006699"><b>xor_bits()</b></font> e.g.
<eucode>
           if a xor b then...
</eucode>
   <font color="#993333"><_bq>xor</_bq></font> works on sequences too.
   It's similar to <font color="#993333"><_bq>or</_bq></font>.

<p>
<li>
 The <font color="#006699"><b>dir(path)</b></font> library routine now
 officially supports the use of <b>wildcards *</b> and <b>?</b> in the path
 that you supply. This feature was always available, but wasn't
 documented until now. e.g.
<eucode>
           info = dir("mydata\\*.d?t")
</eucode>

<li>
 <font color="#CC3366"><b>optimization:</b></font>
  Subroutine call+return overhead was reduced by an average of 
   30%. The speed-up occurs for all normal function/procedure/type calls, 
   user-defined type-checks,
   <font color="#006699">call_proc()/call_func()</font> calls using a
   <font color="#993333"><b>routine id</b></font>, 
   and Windows call-backs. Only recursive calls cost the same as before. 
   Programs with a reasonably-high frequency of calls can easily be 10% faster 
   overall because of this.

<p>
<li>
 <font color="#CC3366"><b>optimization:</b></font>
 Branch <font color="#CC0099"><_bq><i>straightening</i></_bq></font> has been
  implemented. The compiler will optimize branches in the internal code
   such that a branch from A->B where location B contains a branch to
   location C, will be optimized to a direct branch from A->C. Even something
   like A->B->C->D can be straightened to A->D. This often occurs in
   while-loops that contain if-statements.

<p>
<li>
 <font color="#CC3366"><b>optimization:</b></font>
 In many cases, variable initialization checks are
   now replaced by "no-ops" after the first check is performed. Euphoria
   was already optimizing out many checks at compile-time.

<p>
<li>
 <font color="#CC3366"><b>optimization:</b></font>
 <font color="#006699"><b>get()</b></font> and
 <font color="#006699"><b>value()</b></font> are now much faster in most
  cases thanks to Jiri Babor and some further optimizations by RDS.
   The new v2.1 <font color="#993333"><b>ex.exe</b></font> with the new
   v2.1 <font color="#5500FF"><b>get.e</b></font> is:
<blockquote>
          <p>
          1.45x faster reading a sequence of f.p. numbers from a file and<br>
          2.25x faster when reading a sequence of integers from a file.
</blockquote>

<p>
<li>
 <font color="#CC3366"><b>optimization:</b></font>
 <font color="#006699"><b>power(x,2)</b></font> is converted internally
  to x*x which is faster in all cases, especially when x is a large
  integer or a f.p. number. 

<p>
<li>
 <font color="#CC3366"><b>optimization:</b></font> Thanks to Jiri Babor,
 <font color="#006699"><b>int_to_bits()</b></font> is at least 15% faster
   in most cases.

<p>
<li>
 <font color="#CC3366"><b>optimization:</b></font>
 Plotting a long sequence of pixels in 16-color graphics modes 
 is about 3% faster.

<p>
<li>
 <font color="#CC3366"><b>optimization:</b></font>
 <font color="#006699"><b>draw_line()</b></font> has been sped up by a
  few percent.

<p>
<li>
 <font color="#5500FF"><b>Language War</b></font> has had a major
 face-lift. It now runs in <font color="#CC3366"><b>pixel-graphics
   mode 18</b></font> (640 x 480 x 16 colors) instead of
   <font color="#CC3366"><b>text mode</b></font>. It also has 
   <font color="#CC0099"><_bq><i>fine-grain</i></_bq></font> parallelism,
   i.e. virtually anything can happen in parallel 
   with anything else. Multiple torpedos, phasors etc can be drawn on the 
   screen simultaneously, while ships are moving, commands are being entered,
   things are exploding etc. Even the timing needed for the PC speaker sound 
   effects is handled by the <b>task scheduler</b>. There are
   <font color="#CC0099"><b><i>no</i></b></font> time-delay "busy" 
   loops executed during the game. The galaxy scan now shows you a scaled 
   picture of the whole galaxy, rather than just a bunch of numbers.

<p>
<li>
 The default print format for atoms was changed from "%g" to "%<b>.</b>10g".
   This format is used by <font color="#006699">print()</font>,
   <font color="#993333"><b>?</b></font>,
   the <font color="#993333"><b>trace</b></font> facility, and
   <font color="#5500FF"><b>ex.err</b></font> dumps. This allows large
   integers -9,999,999,999 to +9,999,999,999
   to be printed as integers, rather than as scientific notation. It also 
   provides about 10 digits of accuracy to be displayed on fractional numbers,
   rather than just 6. Art Adamson and others made it clear that more 
   digits should be displayed.

<p>
<li>
 The state of all <font color="#993333"><b>with/without</b></font> settings
  is saved upon entering an <b>included file</b>, and restored at the end
  of the <b>included file</b>. An included file can change the settings,
  but they will be restored at the end of the included file. e.g. warnings
   might be turned off just within the included file (and any files it
   includes). As a result some 
   programs now display warnings where none were seen before.

<p>
<li>
 Warnings are now displayed
 <font color="#CC0099"><_ba><i>after</i></_ba></font> your program finishes
 execution, so they won't be erased by
 <font color="#006699">clear_screen()</font>,
 <font color="#006699">graphics_mode()</font> etc.
 Some programs now show warnings where none were seen before.

<p>
<li>
 The security of scrambled code and bound code has been improved thanks to 
 ideas contributed by Rusty Davis. When a bound program starts executing,
 a quick integrity check will be made to detect any corruption or tampering.
 It's still ok to add data to the end of a
 <b><font color="#993333">bound</font> .exe</b> file, as long as
 your last line is <font color="#006699"><_bq>abort(x)</_bq></font>.

<p>
<li>
 The <font color="#993333"><b>ed</b></font> editor now lets you view and
 edit beyond column 80.

<p>
<li>
 <font color="#993333"><b>ed</b></font> has a new command: <b>Esc m</b>
 (modifications). It will show the differences between the original file on
 disk and the current edit buffer. This can be very useful when you've
 forgotten what changes you've made, and you are wondering if it's safe to
 save them.

<p>
<li>
 The <font color="#993333"><b>trace</b></font> window now provides an upper
 case <b>Q</b> command which lets the program run to completion, ignoring
 any <font color="#006699">trace(1)</font> commands. Lower case
 <b>q</b> lets it run to the next <font color="#006699">trace(1)</font>.

<p>
<li>
 <font color="#5500FF"><b>safe.e</b></font> (debug version of
 <font color="#5500FF"><b>machine.e</b></font>) has been enhanced. It will now 
   automatically catch additional cases where data is illegally written just 
   <b><i>before</i></b>, or just <b><i>after</i></b>, the boundaries of an
   allocated block of memory. This can be particularly useful in
   <font color="#CC3366"><b>WIN32</b></font> where Windows might overwrite 
   one of your under-sized blocks. Without a tool such as
   <font color="#5500FF"><b>safe.e</b></font>, this type 
   of bug could take hours or even days to track down.

<p>
<li>
 The <font color="#5500FF"><b>euphoria\tutorial</b></font> directory
 was created to hold several small tutorial programs.

<p>
<li>
 The limit on the number of open files was raised to 25 from 15.
   Three of these files are 0,1,2: standard-input, standard-output 
   and standard-error, so you can now have up to 22 of your own files
   open simultaneously. (As far as we know, no one ever exceeded the old 
   limit, but it seemed wise to raise it.)

<p>
<li>
 When the user simply types <font color="#993333"><_bq>ex</_bq></font> or
 <font color="#993333"><_bq>exw</_bq></font> and is prompted for the 
   name of the Euphoria <b>.ex</b> or <b>.exw</b> file to run,
   <font color="#006699"><b>command_line()</b></font> will now 
   be updated to include the filename as the second command-line argument,
   just as if the user had originally typed: <_bq>ex filename</_bq>.
   Thanks to Mathew Hounsell for suggesting this.

<p>
<li>
 <font color="#5500FF"><b>mset.ex</b></font> now saves pictures in <b>.bmp</b>
 format. Previously it was using a non-standard, compressed format.

<p>
<li>
 <font color="#5500FF"><b>lines.ex</b></font>
 (<font color="#5500FF"><b>lines.bat</b></font>) now reports
 non-blank/non-comment lines as well. This is
 <font color="#CC0099"><_ba><i>not</i></_ba></font> the same as the
 "statement count" used by Euphoria for the diagnostic limit, but it's
 usually within +/- 10%, assuming you write one statement per line.

<p>
<li>
 Numeric literals greater than 1e308 (roughly) are now set to
 <b>+/-</b> <_bq>inf</_bq>. They used to cause a compile-time error.

<b><_dul>Version 2.0 Official Release March 25, 1998:</_dul></b></font>

<ul>
<li>
 The install procedure has changed. The Euphoria .zip file now contains a 
   large <_bq>bundle.dat</_bq> file that contains over 100 files. This
   makes it easier for people to locate the important files:
   <font color="#5500FF"><b>readme.doc</b></font>,
   <font color="#5500FF"><b>install.bat</b></font>, etc. 
   that they should look at before installing. The .zip file is also 35K
   smaller as a result.

<p>
<li>
 <font color="#993333"><b>shroud</b></font> will warn you to use
 <font color="#993333"><b>bind/bindw</b></font> if you try to create a
 shrouded source file with a name ending in "<b>.</b>exe".

</ul>

<p>&nbsp;<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#003366">
<b><_dul>Version 2.0 (beta) February 26, 1998:</_dul></b></font>

<ul>
<li>
 The WIN32 interpreter, <font color="#993333"><b>exw.exe</b></font>, is now
 a <font color="#006633"><b>true WIN32 GUI</b></font> program. In 
 2.0 alpha it was a WIN32 <_bq><i>console</i></_bq> program that was always
 associated with a <_bq><i>console</i></_bq> or DOS-window. A DOS-style
 console window will now be created only if your program needs one.
 <font color="#993333"><b>exw</b></font> will automatically create 
 a new console window the first time your program writes to the screen, reads 
 from the keyboard, or calls any library routine that requires a console to 
 work. The console will disappear automatically when your program finishes 
 execution. 

<p>
<li>
 A new library routine, <font color="#006699"><b>free_console()</b></font>,
 will immediately delete the console window if you currently have one.

<p>
<li>
 The Complete Edition of Euphoria now provides a
 <font color="#993333"><b>-scramble</b></font> option of
 <font color="#993333"><b>bind</b></font> and
 <font color="#993333"><b>shroud</b></font> to improve the security of
 programs that you distribute.

<p>
<li>
 You can now pass Euphoria <font color="#993333"><b>atoms</b></font> to
 C routines as 64-bit C double type floating-point arguments, and you can
 receive a floating-point result back from a C function.

<p>
<li>
 <font color="#993333"><b>exw.exe (beta)</b></font> runs 10 to 15% faster
 than <font color="#993333"><b>exw.exe (alpha)</b></font> (based on 
 <font color="#5500FF"><b>sieve.ex</b></font>,
 <font color="#5500FF"><b>shell.ex</b></font>, etc.). The WATCOM C compiler
 was doing a bad job of optimizing a critical section of the interpreter
 when building exw.exe, but was producing excellent code when building
 <font color="#993333"><b>ex.exe</b></font>.
 With some trivial changes to the interpreter C code, WATCOM now produces
 excellent code for both platforms.

<p>
<li>
 The average program now has 60K more memory available before having to 
 use the swap file.

<p>
<li>
 The limit on the size of a single procedure, function or type has been 
 eliminated. 

<p>
<li>
 The limit on the size of a single top-level statement has been eliminated.

<p>
<li>
 The limit on the total number of include files that can make up a program
   has been increased to 256 from 150.

<p>
<li>
 Some <font color="#CC3366"><b>optimizations</b></font> were added. The
 following general forms of expression are now faster:
<eucode>
           2 * x 
           x * 2 
           1 + x 
</eucode>
     where x can be any expression, and have type atom or sequence.

<p>
<li>
 There is a new documentation file,
 <font color="#5500FF"><b>perform.doc</b></font> with lots of tips for
 performance-obsessed programmers.

<p>
<li>
 If you call a C routine using <font color="#006699"><b>c_func()</b></font>,
 but you linked the C routine using
 <font color="#006699"><b>define_c_proc()</b></font> you will get an error
 message. Similarly, if you call it using
 <font color="#006699"><b>c_proc()</b></font>, but you linked it using
 <font color="#006699"><b>define_c_func()</b></font> you'll get 
 an error message. This restriction was documented, but not actually 
 enforced in 2.0 alpha. Some programs written for the alpha release will 
 have to be corrected.

<p>
<li>
 You will now see the actual name of the C or Euphoria routine that you
 were attempting to call, when you get an error message from
 <font color="#006699"><b>call_proc()</b></font>,
 <font color="#006699"><b>call_func()</b></font>,
 <font color="#006699"><b>c_proc()</b></font>,
 or <font color="#006699"><b>c_func()</b></font>.

<p>
<li>
 A new <b>-clear_routines</b> option of
  <font color="#993333"><b>bind</b></font> and
  <font color="#993333"><b>shroud</b></font> will leave the names of
  all routines unshrouded. This is necessary if your program calls 
  <font color="#006699"><b>routine_id()</b></font>. You'll be warned if you
  use routine_id() and do not choose this option. (Registered users can
  use <font color="#993333"><b>-scramble</b></font> together with
  <b>-clear_routines</b> to restore a high level of shrouding.)

<p>
<li>
 If a name conflict arises with a global symbol, the
  <font color="#993333"><b>shrouder</b></font> will now warn you, and then
  choose a new name. It used to abort with a message.

<p>
<li>
 It is no longer possible to <font color="#993333"><b>trace</b></font>
 or <font color="#993333"><b>profile</b></font> shrouded code.

<p>
<li>
 A new demo program, <font color="#5500FF"><b>hash.ex</b></font>, was added
  to <font color="#5500FF"><b>euphoria\demo</b></font>.

<p>
<li>
 <font color="#5500FF"><b>freq.ex</b></font> was moved from
 <font color="#5500FF"><b>euphoria\bin</b></font> to
 <font color="#5500FF"><b>euphoria\demo</b></font> and renamed as
 <font color="#5500FF"><b>tree.ex</b></font>.

<p>
<li>
 A new documentation file, <font color="#5500FF"><b>bind.doc</b></font>
 describes all the features of <font color="#5500FF"><b>bind.bat</b></font>
 and <font color="#5500FF"><b>shroud.bat</b></font>. The previous description
 in <font color="#5500FF"><b>refman.doc</b></font> has been shrunk.

<p>
<li>
 The file <font color="#5500FF"><b>overview.doc</b></font> gives a quick
 overview of all documentation files.

<p>
<li>
 The description of <font color="#006699"><b>get_mouse()</b></font> in
 <font color="#5500FF"><b>library.doc</b></font> discusses the problem of
 320-wide graphics modes (you must divide the x coordinate value by 2).

 The following additional improvements have been made to the
  <font color="#CC3366"><b>DOS32</b></font> version:

<ul>
<p><li>
    On Pentium and higher systems, floating-point calculations are now
    about 20% faster (and floating-point in
    <font color="#993333"><b>exw</b></font> is a further 20%
    faster than <font color="#993333"><b>ex</b></font> for 2.0).

<p><li>
    <font color="#006699"><b>printf()</b></font> to the screen, and

    significantly faster in most cases.

<p><li>

    faster.

<p><li>
    The <font color="#993333"><b>time profile</b></font> is more accurate
    regarding <font color="#006699"><b>getc()</b></font>.

<b><_dul>Version 1.5a June 13, 1997:</_dul></b></font>

<ul>
<li>
 Many operations and library routines were optimized. 

<ul>
<p><li>
   <font color="#006699"><b>get_key()</b></font> is
   100x faster when there is no key in the buffer.

<p><li>
   <font color="#006699"><b>get_all_palette()</b></font> is over 100x faster
   and this makes <font color="#006699"><b>save_screen()</b></font> much faster.

<p><li>
   The following routines have now been built directly into
   <font color="#993333"><b>ex.exe</b></font>, to avoid the overhead of
   calling <font color="#006699">machine_proc()</font> or
   <font color="#006699">machine_func()</font>:
   <font color="#006699"><b>pixel()</b></font>, 
   <font color="#006699"><b>get_pixel()</b></font>,
   <font color="#006699"><b>mem_set()</b></font>,
   <font color="#006699"><b>mem_copy()</b></font>.

<p><li>
   <font color="#006699"><b>poke()</b></font> of a long sequence into memory,
   other than video memory, is 50% faster.

<p><li>
   <font color="#006699"><b>pixel()</b></font> is 4x faster in mode 19.

<p><li>
   <font color="#006699"><b>get_pixel()</b></font> is faster in all modes.

<p><li>
   <font color="#006699"><b>display_image()</b></font> is about 30% faster in
   most modes and up to 4x faster in mode 19, 
   because <br><font color="#006699">pixel()</font> is faster.

<p><li>
   All arithmetic and bitwise operations applied to sequences of integers are 
   now 29% faster.  

<p><li>
   a <font color="#993333"><b>&</b></font> b (concatenation) is 15% faster
   in most cases, and is dramatically faster in the case where you grow a
   very long sequence by concatenating many small sequences onto it. 

<p><li>
   <font color="#006699"><b>getc()</b></font> is 12% faster.

<p><li>
   <font color="#006699"><b>match()</b></font> is 8% faster in typical cases.

<p><li>
   <font color="#006699"><b>append()/prepend()</b></font> are 15% faster in
   many cases.

<p><li>
   <font color="#006699"><b>find()</b></font> of an integer within a
   sequence of integers is 64% faster.

<p><li>
   Formation of a 2-element sequence <b>{a,b}</b> is 11% faster.
