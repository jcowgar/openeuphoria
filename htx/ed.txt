== The Euphoria Editor

=== Introduction

The Euphoria download package includes a handy, text-mode editor, ed, that's written completely in Euphoria. Many people find ed convenient for editing Euphoria programs and other files, but there is no requirement that you use it.

If you don't like **ed**, you have many alternatives. David Cuny's **EE editor** is a DOS-based editor for Euphoria that's also written in Euphoria. It has a friendly mouse-based user interface with drop down menus etc. It's available from the RDS Web site. There are several other Euphoria-oriented editors that run on DOS, Windows, Linux and FreeBSD. Check the **Editors** section of our Archive. In fact, //any// text editor can be used to edit a Euphoria program, including DOS Edit or Windows NotePad.

=== Summary

usage 1: {{{ed filename}}}
usage 2: {{{ed}}}

After any error, just type <font color="#993333"><_bq>ed</_bq></font>, and you'll be placed in the editor, at the line and column where the error was detected. The error message will be at the top of your screen.

Euphoria-related files are displayed in color. Other text files are in mono. You'll know that you have misspelled something when the color does not change as you expect. Keywords are blue. Names of routines that are built in to the interpreter appear in magenta. Strings are green, comments are red, most other text is black. Balanced brackets (on the same line) have the same color. **<font color="#006633">You can change these colors as well as several other parameters of</font> <font color="#993333">ed</font><font color="#006633">.</font>** See "user-modifiable parameters" near the top of <font color="#5500FF">**ed.ex**</font>.


 The arrow keys move the cursor left, right, up or down. Most other characters
 are immediately inserted into the file.
 

 In Windows, you can "associate" various types of files with
 <font color="#5500FF">**ed.bat**</font>. You will then be put into
 <font color="#993333">**ed**</font> when you **double-click**
 on these types of files - e.g. **.e**, **.pro**, **.doc** etc.
 Main Euphoria files ending in **.ex** (**.exw**) might better be
 associated with <font color="#993333"><_bq>ex.exe</_bq></font>
 (<font color="#993333"><_bq>exw.exe</_bq></font>).
 

 <font color="#993333">**ed**</font> is a
 <font color="#CC0099">**multi-file/multi-window**</font> DOS editor.
 **Esc c** will split your screen so you can view and edit up to 10 files
 simultaneously, with cutting and pasting between them. You can also use
 multiple edit windows to view and edit different parts of a single file. 

=== Special Keys

<P>Some PC keys do not work in a Linux or FreeBSD text console, or in Telnet, 
and some keys do not work in an xterm under X windows. Alternate keys 
have been provided. In some cases on Linux/FreeBSD you might have to 
edit ed.ex to map the desired key to the desired function.

=== Escape Commands

Press and release the <font color="#006699">**Esc**</font> key, then press one of the following keys:

<table border=0 cellspacing=2 cellpadding=2>
<tr>
	<td><font color="#006699">h</font></td>
	<td>Get help text for the editor, or Euphoria. The screen is split so you can view your program and the help text at the same time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><font color="#006699">c</font></td>
	<td> "Clone" the current window, i.e. make a new edit window that is initially viewing the same file at the same position as the current window. The sizes of all windows are adjusted to make room for the new window. You might want to use **Esc l** to get more lines on the screen. Each window that you create can be scrolled independently and each has its own menu bar. The changes that you make to a file will initially appear only in the current window. When you press an **F-key** to select a new window, any changes will appear there as well. You can use **Esc n** to read a new file into any window.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><font color="#006699">q</font></td>
	<td>Quit (delete) the current window and leave the editor if there are no more windows. You'll be warned if this is the last window used for editing a modified file. Any remaining windows are given more space.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><font color="#006699">s</font></td>
	<td>Save the file being edited in the current window, then quit the current window as **Esc q** above.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><font color="#006699">w</font></td>
	<td>Save the file but do not quit the window.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><font color="#006699">e</font></td>
	<td>Save the file, and then execute it with <font color="#993333">**ex**</font>, <font color="#993333">**exw**</font> or <font color="#993333">**exu**</font>. When the program finishes execution you'll hear a beep. Hit **Enter** to return to the editor. This operation may not work if you are very low on extended memory. You   can't supply any <font color="#993333">**command-line arguments**</font> to the program.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><font color="#006699">d</font></td>
	<td>Run an operating system command. After the beep, hit **Enter** to return to the editor. You could also use this command to edit another file and then return, but **Esc c** is probably more convenient.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><font color="#006699">n</font></td>
	<td>Start editing a new file in the current window. Deleted lines/chars and search strings are available for use in the new file. You must type in the path to the new file. Alternatively, you can drag a file name from a Windows file manager window into the MS-DOS window for <font color="#993333">**ed**</font>. This will type the full path for you.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td><font color="#006699">f</font></td>
	<td>Find the next occurrence of a string in the current window. When you type in a new string there is an option to "match case" or not. Press **y** if you require upper/lower case to match. Keep hitting **Enter** to find subsequent occurrences. Any other key stops the search. To search from the beginning, press **control-Home** before **Esc f**. The default string to search for, if you don't type anything, is shown in double quotes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><font color="#006699">r</font></td>
	<td>Globally replace one string by another. Operates like **Esc f** command. Keep hitting **Enter** to continue replacing. Be careful -- //there is no way to skip over a possible replacement.//</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><font color="#006699">l</font></td>
	<td>Change the number of lines displayed on the screen. Only certain values are allowed, depending on your video card. Many cards will allow 25, 28, 43 and 50 lines. In a Linux/FreeBSD text console you're stuck with the number of lines available (usually 25). In a Linux/FreeBSD xterm window, **ed** will use the number of lines initially available when ed is started up. Changing the size of the window will have no effect after ed is started.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><font color="#006699">m</font></td>
	<td>Show the modifications that you've made so far. The current edit buffer is saved as <font color="#993333">**editbuff.tmp**</font>, and is compared with the file on disk using the DOS **fc** command, or the Linux/FreeBSD **diff** command. **Esc m** is very useful when you want to quit the editor, but you can't remember what changes you made, or whether it's ok to save them. It's also useful when you make an editing mistake and you want to see what the original text looked like.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><font color="#006699">//ddd//</font></td>
	<td>Move to line number //ddd//. e.g. **Esc 1023 Enter** would move to line 1023 in the file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><font color="#006699">CR</font></td>
	<td>**Esc Carriage-Return**, i.e. **Esc Enter**, will tell you the name of the current file, as well as the line and character position you are on, and whether the file has been modified since the last save. If you press **Esc** and then change your mind, it is harmless to just hit **Enter** so you can go back to editing.</td>
</tr>

=== Recalling Previous Strings

The **Esc n**, **Esc d**, **Esc r** and **Esc f** commands prompt you to enter a string. You can recall and edit these strings just as you would at the DOS or Linux/FreeBSD command line. Type up-arrow or down-arrow to cycle through strings that you previously entered for a given command, then use left-arrow, right-arrow and the delete key to edit the strings. Press Enter to submit the string.

=== Cutting and Pasting

When you <font color="#006699">**control-Delete**</font> (or <font color="#006699">**control-D**</font>) a series of consecutive lines, or <font color="#006699">**Delete**</font> a series of consecutive characters, you create a "kill-buffer" containing what you just deleted. This kill-buffer can be re-inserted by moving the cursor and then pressing <font color="#006699">**Insert**</font>.


 A new kill-buffer is started, and the old buffer is lost, each time you move
 away and start deleting somewhere else. For example, cut a series of
 <_ba>//lines//</_ba> with
 <font color="#006699">**control-Delete**</font>. Then move the
 cursor to where you want to paste the lines and press
 <font color="#006699">**Insert**</font>. If you want to copy the lines,
 without destroying the original text, first
 <font color="#006699">**control-Delete**</font> them, then immediately
 press <font color="#006699">**Insert**</font> to re-insert them. Then
 move somewhere else and press <font color="#006699">**Insert**</font> to
 insert them again, as many times as you like. You can also
 <font color="#006699">**Delete**</font> a series of individual
 <_ba>//characters//</_ba>, move the cursor, and then paste the deleted
 characters somewhere else. Immediately press
 <font color="#006699">**Insert**</font> after deleting if you want to
 copy without removing the original characters.

 Once you have a kill-buffer, you can type
 <font color="#006699">**Esc n**</font> to read in a new file, or you can
 press an <font color="#006699">**F-key**</font> to select a new edit
 window. You can then insert your kill-buffer.

=== Use of Tabs


 The standard //tab// width is 8 spaces. The editor assumes
 tab=8 for most files. However, it is more convenient when editing a
 program for a tab to equal the amount of space that you like to indent.
 Therefore you will find that tabs are set to 4 when you edit Euphoria files
 (or .c, or .h or .bas files). The editor converts from tab=8 to tab=4 when
 reading your //program// file, and converts back to tab=8 when you save
 the file. Thus your file remains compatible with the tab=8 world, e.g.
 MS-DOS PRINT, EDIT, etc. <font color="#006633">**If you would like to
 choose a different number of spaces to indent**</font>, change the line
 at the top of <font color="#5500FF">**ed.ex**</font> that says "constant
 PROG_INDENT = 4".

=== Long Lines


 Lines that extend beyond the right edge of the screen are marked with an 
 //inverse video// character in the 80th column. This warns you that
 there is more text "out there" that you can't see. You can move the cursor
 beyond the 80th column. The screen will scroll left or right so the cursor
 position is always visible.

=== Maximum File Size


 Like any Euphoria program, <font color="#993333">**ed**</font> can access
 all the memory on your machine. It can edit huge files, and unless 
 disk swapping occurs, most operations will be very fast.

=== Non-text Files


 <font color="#993333">**ed**</font> is designed for editing pure text
 files, although you can use it to view other files. As
 <font color="#993333">**ed**</font> reads in a file, it replaces certain
 non-printable characters (less than ASCII 14) with ASCII 254 - small square.
 //If you try to save a non-text file you will be warned about this.//
 (MS-DOS Edit will quietly corrupt a non-text file - do not save!).
 Since <font color="#993333">**ed**</font> opens all files as "text" files,
 a **control-z** character (26) embedded in a file will appear to ed to be 
 the //end of the file//.

=== Long Filenames


 Although **ed** is a DOS editor, you can edit 
 //existing// files that have pathnames with long names in
 them, and the full file name will be preserved. However in this release
 <font color="#993333">**ed**</font> will not create
 <_ba>//new//</_ba> files with long names. The name will be
 truncated to the standard DOS 8.3 length. (but see Platform below)

=== Line Terminator


 The end-of-line terminator on Linux/FreeBSD is simply **\n**. On DOS
 and Windows, text files have lines ending with **\r\n**.
 If you copy a DOS or Windows file to Linux/FreeBSD and try to modify it,
 **ed** will give you a choice of either keeping the **\r\n** terminators,
 or saving the file with **\n** terminators.

=== Source Code

The complete source code to this editor is in <font color="#5500FF">**bin\ed.ex**</font> and <font color="#5500FF">**bin\syncolor.e**</font>. You are welcome to make improvements. There is a section at the top of <font color="#5500FF">**ed.ex**</font> containing "user-modifiable" configuration parameters that you can adjust. The colors and the cursor size may need adjusting for some operating environments.

=== Platform

<font color="#993333">**euphoria\bin\ed.bat**</font> can be set up to run ed.ex using <font color="#993333">**exwc.exe**</font> or <font color="#993333">**ex.exe**</font>. You are better off running ed with <font color="#993333">**ex.exe**</font> on Windows 95/98/ME. You'll get much quicker screen updates than with <font color="#993333">**exwc.exe**</font>. On Windows XP you'll be a bit better off using <font color="#993333">**exwc.exe**</font>. You'll get slightly quicker screen updates, and you'll be able to create files with long names, not just open existing ones. However some special keys won't work with <font color="#993333">**exwc.exe**</font>, e.g. you'll have to use control-t and control-b instead of control-Home and control-End. On Linux and FreeBSD there are no problems with long filenames, and the keyboard response is always fast.
