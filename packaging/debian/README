Making a Debian package

Required:  

euphoria:   Working euphoria installation.
debhelper:  This package is used to help build the package.
eudoc:      Generates the euphoria documentation
creolehtml: Converts the eudoc output to html

Both eudoc and creolehtml are in the tools section of the euphoria
source code repository.

From the packaging/debian directory, simply type:

$ ./configure && make

The process should be automated.  It will build a source and a binary package.
It will build a package with either i386 or amd64, depending upon the 
host machine.
