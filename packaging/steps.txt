1. Update version numbers in source/version.mak and source/version.jam

2. Update the OpDefines variable for Major, Minor, Release
   defines (4.0.0 = EU4_0_0, EU4_0, EU4), (4.1.1 = EU4_1_1, EU_4_1, EU_4),
   etc... This variable is located in parser.e, the function
   InitGlobals.

3. Run all tests, interpreted and compiled on Windows, Linux and OS X.
   If you do not have access to all those platforms, ask for the
   current SVN head to be tested on the Euphoria Dev List and wait
   for reports to come back to the status of each operating system.

4. Tag the release:

   svn cp http://rapideuphoria.svn.sourceforge.net/trunk
     http://rapideuphoria.svn.sourceforge.net/tags/4.0b1

   4.0b1 should be whatever release you are tagging, of course.

5. Execute various scripts in packaging/. See each script for
   instructions.
