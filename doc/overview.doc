 The Euphoria documentation is spread over several plain text files in the
 euphoria\doc directory. For each .doc file in the euphoria\doc directory,
 there is a corresponding .htm file in the euphoria\html directory. You can
 also type guru to quickly search for relevant information from all directories
 under \euphoria.

 Everyone should start with euphoria\readme.doc (euphoria\readme.htm).
